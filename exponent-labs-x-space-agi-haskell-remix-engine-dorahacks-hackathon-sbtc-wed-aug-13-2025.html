So long story short, without being too boring, today I used what I learned about programming to create a remix engine. It takes a song and we arranges the song to make a new song. I know that it's kind of on the left field, but that's what I just did. Using the learning that I have now. So the song extension is just a way to prove that the way that we're thinking and creating software works."

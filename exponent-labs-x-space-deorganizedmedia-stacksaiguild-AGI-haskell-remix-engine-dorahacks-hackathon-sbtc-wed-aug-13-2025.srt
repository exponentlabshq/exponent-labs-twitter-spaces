00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,125
Hello, my name is Michael
Jag day when I'm a head

2
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,627
hunter launching startups
with the syndicate.

3
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:28,294
Hello.

4
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,396
My name is Michael J.

5
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,431
Gavin,
and I'm a headhunter

6
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,067
launching startups
with the syndicate

7
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:36,102
once again.

8
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,771
My name is Michael Jaggu

9
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,273
and I should be
speaking into the mike.

10
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:40,740
Hello.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,176
My name is Michael Jag
Deo, and I'm a headhunter

12
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,678
launching startups
with the syndicate.

13
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:46,479
Hello.

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,114
My name is Michael
Jag day.

15
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,849
When I'm a headhunter

16
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,352
launching startups
with the syndicate.

17
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:55,422
On today's episode
of The Syndicate, we.

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,892
Well,

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,394
we've created
a remix engine.

20
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,030
Have you ever heard
Katy Perry's

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,533
Harleys in Hawaii?

22
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:11,805
Well,

23
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,307
if you haven't,
then I'll listen to it.

24
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,010
It's a very upbeat song.

25
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,512
It's what happens.

26
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,514
Harleys in Hawaii

27
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,150
is a song made by
a Becky in the Caribbean.

28
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,655
Okay.

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,257
She doesn't realizes

30
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:31,925
those guys are going to

31
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,259
take her
for all their money.

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,762
She thinks
she's getting purses.

33
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,901
She has another thing
coming.

34
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,270
Yeah, anacondas in Hawaii.

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,339
Shit comes with a reverse
alimony

36
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,708
that's upside
down in the Caribbean.

37
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,577
It's like Yoda in the end.

38
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:55,048
This is patois,
not English. Any.

39
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,420
So here's the big idea.

40
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,823
So I don't waste
your time.

41
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,592
I'm going to try
to speak in a way

42
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,961
that at every moment
that after

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,164
every word, you can decide

44
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,666
whether to stop listening
or not.

45
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:15,935
Hello,

46
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,438
my name is Michael
Jag Dale,

47
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,740
and I am a headhunter
launching startups

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,243
with the syndicate.

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,480
I am learning
how to program

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,650
and change
the environment.

51
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,851
Change the behavior.

52
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,685
Matthias Baer.

53
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,188
Hey, I am

54
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,460
evolving in the context
of the places I'm in.

55
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,799
And the people I'm with.

56
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,202
The people I'm with

57
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,704
taught me how to code.

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,943
Since I am a

59
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,280
musician at heart
and you had to play music

60
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,782
before I ever got
a computer,

61
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,518
I've been

62
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,020
through Geometry of Music,

63
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,522
creating remixes
of my favorite songs.

64
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,891
Often times

65
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,459
my favorite songs
are songs

66
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,563
that I make myself, that
I remix of artists I like,

67
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,732
but I don't like their,
I don't like the

68
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,669
the arrangement
of the song,

69
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,370
but I like the elements.

70
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,772
So we have an instrumental

71
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,340
and we have the vocalists,

72
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,743
and sometimes I like the
pre-chorus to be the intro

73
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,178
instead of the intro.

74
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,546
And sometimes
I'd like swap.

75
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,049
I want to swap
the pre-chorus and intro,

76
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:36,649
right?

77
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,451
Or maybe start with

78
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,054
the pre-chorus
chorus and then verse.

79
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,757
Or maybe start

80
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,260
with the post chorus,

81
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,062
then going into the verse.

82
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,064
Does that make sense?

83
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,066
And so I've been doing

84
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,568
that manually for
as long as I can remember.

85
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,371
Using Fruity Loops Studio
to sequence, right?

86
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,873
You have an instrumental
which stays fixed,

87
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,476
and then you have vocal

88
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,211
pieces that you rearrange

89
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,780
into a new sequence
of the same song.

90
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:10,717
And so

91
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,219
and learning how to code,

92
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,888
I thought today, hey,

93
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,491
now that I'm using

94
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,894
a language
that can represent

95
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,597
the real world,
which is Haskell

96
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,100
because of its pure
functional nature,

97
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,971
I wonder if I can
implement the way I do

98
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,074
remixes in Haskell
and then Python.

99
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,544
Long story short, I did.

100
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,448
And that's kind of it.

101
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,583
That's a whole thing.

102
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,184
I'll respond
to the space with,

103
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,888
samples of the remix

104
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,590
showing
you where it worked

105
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,059
and where it didn't,
and then showing you

106
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,561
the creation
I made after it.

107
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,264
Long story short, if
we're going to create AGI,

108
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,134
a productive AGI is an API

109
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,636
that incorporates
humans to get better,

110
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,939
and you need humans
to get better

111
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,243
because
we need a system that

112
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,514
marries documented SOPs

113
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,784
with undocumented truths.

114
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,787
The undocumented truths

115
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,289
occur between human beings

116
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,025
and are filtered
into the system.

117
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,361
But without that signal
processing

118
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,064
of human to human,
we will never have full

119
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,598
context.

120
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,934
True context.

121
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,936
That's what we need,
a true context.

122
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,404
And we cannot pretend

123
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,972
that the machines alone
are going to be able

124
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,208
to process
all of the signals,

125
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,711
nor should we expect
it to.

126
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:45,712
Just by the way,

127
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,115
if that makes sense.

128
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,617
So. Oh, okay.

129
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,452
So that's it.

130
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,954
I'll post
the images at the bottom,

131
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,957
including

132
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,292
Haskell.

133
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,560
That was the right
language.

134
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,627
Thank you. Chase.

135
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,096
Thanks, Matt. Yes.

136
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,331
Paul Vance, former

137
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,834
K hero.

138
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,203
What are you.

139
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,405
What are you up
to, Einstein?

140
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,440
What's going on?

141
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,411
My brain has, broken.

142
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,412
Over the past month.

143
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,881
I've been learning
how to code and

144
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,084
figured out how to do more
than just pretty UI's.

145
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,520
For the past year,
I've been doing

146
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,789
nice looking
UI without a brain.

147
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,291
I figured out the back
end brain part, so

148
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,761
I'm just creating

149
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,263
prototypes now.

150
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,232
What do you mean
without other brain?

151
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,299
What are you referring to?

152
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,902
So when I create
using for thought

153
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,638
deaf or lovable thought,
you or any of these

154
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,508
other things that turn
your ideas into web apps,

155
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,710
I was creating

156
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,679
really
good looking frontends.

157
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,650
But because they didn't
have any any Python or

158
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,920
any open AI integrations
or any integrations,

159
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,356
they were still just
pretty looking.

160
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,992
It was like an icing
on a rotten cake.

161
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,261
Does that make sense?
Or an empty cake?

162
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,496
I didn't have something
to drink and interact

163
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,899
with the user
and do complex things.

164
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,067
I just learned
how to do all the complex

165
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,570
things
to turn my user interfaces

166
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,673
into actual applications.

167
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,977
So long story short,
without being too boring,

168
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,913
today
I used what I learned

169
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,449
about programing
to create a remix engine.

170
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,786
It takes a song
and we arranges the song

171
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,256
to make a new song.

172
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,760
I know that it's
kind of on the left field,

173
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,727
but that's what
I just did.

174
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,196
Using the
learning that I have now.

175
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,835
Okay, cool.

176
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,503
But you are just

177
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,005
doing it for the sake of,

178
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,943
learning how
to construct the brain.

179
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,812
Or are you doing it
so that you think

180
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,349
there's an opportunity
for that specific,

181
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,686
song remix engine?

182
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,056
So the song extension is
just a way

183
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,426
to prove that the way
that we're thinking

184
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,496
and creating software
works.

185
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:21,067
And, right now
is the syndicate

186
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,369
with Rossi
and the rest of the team.

187
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,672
We're creating a, an AGI,

188
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,141
which will help us.

189
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,410
Collaborate better

190
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,913
and produce
outputs faster.

191
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,981
So that's why I'm doing

192
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,849
all these things
that are exploring,

193
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,285
because we're now
with cloud code,

194
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,420
going to have agents

195
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,524
that can take
our individual

196
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:48,494
inputs and start
creating outputs.

197
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,398
I'm not sure if
I'm doing two things, but.

198
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,235
So imagine

199
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,304
we want to collaborate
on a project for

200
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,439
AI guilds,
for example, right?

201
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,741
You know what
the problem is?

202
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,576
You have to be
the coordinator.

203
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,078
You have to be the task
master.

204
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:06,879
Is that.

205
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,347
Yeah, right.
That's the one.

206
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,650
And so you become
the bottleneck. No.

207
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,518
That's right.

208
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:12,785
What?

209
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,288
You don't want to be
the task master.

210
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,890
You want to be someone
that gives

211
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,494
the information,
the right information

212
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,664
and tell it what's
the wrong information?

213
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,133
And then it coordinates
and contacts the people.

214
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,635
Does that make sense?

215
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:30,436
Okay,

216
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,606
so one thing the closest
I've heard is,

217
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,908
I think liquid in jump on

218
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,811
the Organized Space
the other day said

219
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,248
the founder was optimizing
his workflow.

220
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,320
In terms of as a CEO,

221
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,557
he was using
a lot of AI tools to help

222
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,661
manage and operate
the team, I guess.

223
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,164
But he was still there
using the,

224
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,434
I think, you know,
like this.

225
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,071
The if he is going to
be effective,

226
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,640
it's going to help us
connect humans

227
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,142
better.

228
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:11,644
Okay.

229
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,446
Does that make sense?

230
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:13,746
Yeah.

231
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,281
I mean, I'm
looking forward

232
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,616
to putting in practice

233
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,652
that like it sounds
it sounds okay in theory,

234
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,389
but in practice, 
see how it works?

235
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,591
I guess I'm
willing to try that out.

236
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,158
Okay.

237
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,827
If you like. Yeah.

238
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,363
So when when is the next,

239
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,866
episode
of stack, say, ideal?

240
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:35,701
Monday?

241
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,770
Monday?

242
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,438
Yes, I am.

243
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,941
So after
his run on Monday.

244
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:47,780
So I've been, 
coordinating top.

245
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,651
So I think we have a team

246
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,120
and I think I have people

247
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,124
to manage, help on the X.

248
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,859
I do,

249
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,295
this is still,
this is still a lot of

250
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,466
stuff that needs to happen
to make it so.

251
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,336
Okay, let's can we
let's do this right now.

252
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,137
You know how I am.

253
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,640
So let's, let's simulate
as if it's Monday.

254
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,742
Bang. It's now Monday.

255
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,377
We're starting the show,

256
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,546
and it's going to show
where I pretend to be

257
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,882
the rest of the community
I'm recording.

258
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,317
So I will be able to take
the transcripts.

259
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,118
Okay.

260
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,454
So this is going to be
it might take us 10

261
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,221
or 15 minutes.

262
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,290
Let's do this. So okay.

263
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,258
It's Monday.

264
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,125
Hello everyone.

265
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,594
Welcome to the stacks
I Gail.

266
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,729
That's right the stacks.

267
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,231
I old, on

268
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,301
last week's show three,
Hannah

269
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,005
became a leader
in the stacks I guild.

270
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,208
He now has Starlink, which
gives him the ability

271
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,877
to communicate in real
time, close to delivery.

272
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,345
And now he's starting

273
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,014
to teach
the rest of the stacks.

274
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,317
I guild how to be just
as successful as he is

275
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,087
in creating marketing
materials like videos

276
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,656
and pictures and GIFs that

277
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,827
market and gain
mindshare for stacks

278
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,629
is the dominant layer
to a Bitcoin hero.

279
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,630
What have I missed?

280
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,634
That was a good
that was a good summary.

281
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,137
I'm speaking to the AI,
not you would.

282
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,105
Does that make sense?

283
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,007
My job is to give the
AI the context it needs

284
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,710
to help us
do the coordination.

285
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,845
So continue.

286
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,947
Oh, what the hell?

287
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,982
So what should I be
saying? What?

288
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:30,816
What should I say?

289
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,418
So what have I missed
so far?

290
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,719
What is the purpose?

291
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,455
What is the Northstar
metric for the stacks

292
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,958
ideal that you're up?

293
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:39,925
Oh, sorry. No, no.

294
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,361
First one
for this important one.

295
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,530
What inspired you
to start the snacks

296
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,899
I killed
in the first place?

297
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,401
What inspired you?

298
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,071
I would say
the initial aspiration

299
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,174
is more selfish reason.

300
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,676
Because I want to learn

301
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,147
about AI tools and seeing

302
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,950
how others
have created amazing AI

303
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:06,852
content.

304
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,923
Visual content,
made me really want to

305
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,559
teach myself,

306
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,061
and learn
from the masters.

307
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,130
And,

308
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,133
that made me
the second order effect,

309
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,470
made me realize,
actually,

310
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,773
this could be
really powerful if

311
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,510
a lot of people knew about
how to do it in stacks,

312
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,848
because it can help stacks
reach a wider

313
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,417
audience and gain
more mindshare, like

314
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,020
you said
in the crypto sphere.

315
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,257
So so let me ask you
this, hero,

316
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,060
what are the tangible
outcomes

317
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,096
that you've seen
in operating the stacks

318
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,499
I killed over the past
couple of months?

319
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,268
The tangible outcomes
that you'd like to see

320
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,771
repeated in the future?

321
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,475
I think, 
the quality of the content

322
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,978
has increased
dramatically.

323
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:11,016
I am seeing a lot of high
production

324
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:15,955
quality visual content
by more and more people.

325
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,656
Maybe somebody started

326
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,159
creating
like a super basic graphic

327
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,862
like I did
maybe a month ago.

328
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,130
Now I can create

329
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,633
a more higher quality

330
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,736
production, visual,
appealing attention,

331
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,974
attracting content.

332
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,911
And, just one case study
and I think,

333
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,848
there have been
more than ten people.

334
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:45,784
I guess they benefited
from this

335
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,788
shared knowledge
and teaching

336
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,259
of how to leverage
and upskill their

337
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,495
AI skill and content
creation.

338
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,429
Now, consider

339
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:57,796
that you're

340
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,031
not only speaking to me,

341
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,801
but you're also speaking
to the Exponent Labs,

342
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,537
AGI, Sindhi,
whatever it is.

343
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,707
So, I'm going to ask you
a question

344
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,576
that's going to 
force you to leave out

345
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,112
certain names,
but emphasize other names.

346
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,915
Who are the actual people

347
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,150
that are producing
the most work

348
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,520
that closely relates
to the ideal outcomes

349
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,023
that you have for this tax
AI guild?

350
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,659
Who which accounts,
which names?

351
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,131
Yes, I would say
three Hana

352
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,967
being one of the key,

353
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,637
I put

354
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,140
high quality production

355
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,475
content leader.

356
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,178
I would say somebody cold

357
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,882
north north answers

358
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,818
is like another
prime candidate.

359
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,921
And there's another guy
called Polly Peck.

360
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,259
Although these names,
believe the displayed

361
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,759
name may

362
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,362
not necessarily translate
to the ax handle,

363
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,532
but are these
are the three main people

364
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,201
plus their disciples,
if you like.

365
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,503
Now, let me ask you this.

366
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,172
Not in terms of output.

367
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,273
That was the first one.

368
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,543
You gave me three names,
not forgot to pronounce

369
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,379
for artists, and three
Hana and Volume Tech,

370
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,982
who were the other people
that are kind of the

371
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,650
social glue on the team,

372
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,385
you know,
how is a basketball team?

373
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,987
And sometimes
there's like an old head

374
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,221
like Charles Oakley

375
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:32,358
that manages the clubhouse
and gets them, but

376
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,058
you know what I mean.

377
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,526
Who are those people
that are

378
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,795
the kind of people
underlying

379
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,731
the people that
make the whole thing work?

380
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,668
So I would say, coach,

381
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,170
I would say currently is
myself.

382
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,973
I'm a pretty good like

383
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,877
I'm pretty good at putting
the team together.

384
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,247
Yeah.

385
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,783
So I think currently
I would be

386
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,252
the, the,

387
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,855
the only,
the maybe there are other

388
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,524
other people who are also,

389
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,594
sort of chiming in,

390
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,931
whenever they feel like

391
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,401
maybe like

392
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,270
Gypsy, a bit of peace,

393
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:22,141
a bit of, cyborg.

394
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,978
I would say
I would describe them

395
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,148
as community member
not yet stepped up to be

396
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,949
somebody like me,

397
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,652
but I would hope that they
could be in the future

398
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,687
so that you don't
even need me.

399
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,422
Right.

400
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,290
So it sounds like
you're interested

401
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,024
in engaging

402
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,627
in a process of success
and planning

403
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,229
wherein you are
being succession planned?

404
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,567
Yes or no? Yes.

405
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,803
I think overall, yes.

406
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,139
Because, I believe
the biggest unlock

407
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,775
is actually, 
in addition to this group,

408
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,445
I would hope
that I can help

409
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,180
shape up another group,

410
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,982
which is developer
focus group,

411
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,553
because I think that's,
it's important

412
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,055
to have different
complementing

413
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,591
complementary guilds

414
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,327
or, communities.

415
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,130
So if you for example,
have an NFT guilds,

416
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:21,300
they will have plenty
of ideas, right?

417
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,670
Lots of people with ideas
but don't have the devs

418
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,072
can, achieve the outcome.

419
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,441
So I believe in,

420
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,444
pairing those visual
skill people

421
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,414
with a lot of ideas
with developers

422
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,417
and then see what
sparks can happen.

423
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,386
I think that's
the most interesting part

424
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,188
when you have different
skill

425
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,090
sets of people
coming together,

426
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,659
that's when
like the collaboration

427
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,460
starts to happen,

428
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,963
when the relationship
starts to get built,

429
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:55,367
when different founders
found their partners,

430
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,237
who are good
at other stuff

431
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,739
and then that can become
a real project,

432
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,609
and the real project
can get real transactions.

433
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:08,814
So, my, my goal,
not my goal,

434
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,018
but to be nice
if I can eventually,

435
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,789
just like,
move on to the next

436
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,526
guild,

437
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,762
if you like, so I can
help build these guilds up

438
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,431
so they can be
self running

439
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,901
without me.

440
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,671
What is the outcome
that three Hana

441
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,841
value pick and nozpheratu

442
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,744
get out of this

443
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,912
involvement.

444
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,481
What is peace, love
and yourself?

445
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,950
Get out of this.

446
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,055
I think for them,

447
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,558
the content creators,

448
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,229
first and foremost,

449
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,899
by teaching others
they are a better mentor.

450
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:04,536
They are also learning
from each other

451
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,472
because each of them
have their own

452
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,476
little niche, part
of the content creation.

453
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,880
And they, they, they
explore different tools.

454
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,181
And then when they come

455
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,683
together
and share the tools,

456
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,185
actually
improve their own skills.

457
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,222
And then if they can
teach up their skills

458
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,390
and teach others
the skills

459
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,859
it helps other skills,

460
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,330
so they have an incentive
to make stacks better.

461
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,800
So I guess in in a sense,
if they can make

462
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,735
more of themselves,

463
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,904
it can hopefully
make stacks better.

464
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,573
At the same time,
if there is

465
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,876
funding available
to help them,

466
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,181
keep doing what they do
the best, whilst being,

467
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,384
compensated
for their time.

468
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:56,288
I think it should be a win
win for them.

469
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,191
And for the ecosystem.

470
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,228
As for peace, love and

471
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,464
and GP

472
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,700
thing, they come
from a marketing angle.

473
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,637
So if they can have,

474
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,773
stack
say I give to be promoted,

475
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,043
to come on their spaces
to create more

476
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,113
shows, via the organized

477
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,883
more tutorials
for, to organize.

478
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,184
It helps to bring

479
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,288
awareness
to their marketing media

480
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,624
agency,
I guess, so benefits them

481
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,361
and yeah, I think I mean,
I also

482
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,298
just they want to help
stacks to grow. So

483
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,167
okay, I understand.

484
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,971
So imagine again
it's Monday right now.

485
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,538
But I know

486
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,041
you know this community
really, really well.

487
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:52,110
Is there anything that
we haven't discussed that

488
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,147
you would want to
try to now?

489
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,584
I don't know what

490
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,753
I should let AGI okay.

491
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,489
Is it easier said.

492
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,658
No. That
stacks is the best

493
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,395
layer
that you can build on.

494
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:12,397
Why would you take it?

495
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,466
What are the 1
or 2 things that separates

496
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,968
stacks
from all other layer twos?

497
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,805
One of the unique ones

498
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,708
is the proof of transfer,
mechanism.

499
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,011
Keep going up.

500
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,448
How stacks can get
a real Bitcoin yield.

501
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,616
And also

502
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,652
the clarity smart contract
aspect

503
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,388
is pretty powerful
with yeah.

504
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,690
Turing
incomplete features.

505
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,326
And you can write
decidable functions

506
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,364
with you know, post
consistency test

507
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,064
if you like.

508
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,166
So it's
can be pretty safe.

509
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,335
Now, question
for you, Aki,

510
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,238
because I think
I like your answer.

511
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,873
What is the significance

512
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,376
of stacks
being a regulated, a

513
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,911
security, so to speak?

514
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,380
Well, it

515
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,082
lacks, funds like,
the coin.

516
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,151
I think your voice is
kind of far away.

517
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,488
Are you using a mic
or using, Yeah, yeah.

518
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,889
And on my
headphones there you go.

519
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:17,963
And. Sorry, Rocky,

520
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:18,130
if you

521
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,965
don't mind, introduce
yourself to the ag

522
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,033
I've been working on
in the background.

523
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,568
It's going to consume

524
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,871
everything we've been
discussing today

525
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:30,308
to help the individuals
in the stacks.

526
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,044
I guild collaborate

527
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,148
without hero
having to mediate

528
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,650
every collaboration event.

529
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,184
Sure.

530
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,952
So this is for the AGI,
right?

531
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:41,820
So recently, yeah,

532
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,389
I started doing, 
Cloud Life,

533
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:47,426
which is a directory
of everything about me.

534
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,395
I'm feeding entire
contacts into cloud code.

535
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,766
So it was it's
pretty incredible.

536
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,535
Like,
I asked it to interview me

537
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,804
the same way that I do PDF
TDs, right?

538
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,073
It separated my life into
current projects, past

539
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,110
achievements, long term
goals, short term goals,

540
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,913
current projects,
completed projects,

541
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,247
planned projects.

542
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,550
It pretty much is
organizing my entire life.

543
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:13,985
And then, clod

544
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,522
also connects to, linear,

545
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,759
which we're using to, 
create actual tickets.

546
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,960
So we're looking to use

547
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,627
the mic

548
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,930
there to push tickets
to the rest of the team.

549
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,432
So we stay focused
and organized.

550
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,800
Right.

551
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,803
And so I asked it what
what I should do next.

552
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:32,270
Right.

553
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,773
I think one of the things
we need to work on

554
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,043
both both for myself,
but for Exponent Labs,

555
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,780
but also stacks
is distribution, right?

556
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,049
Sure. The tech is great.

557
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,853
Like I think DeFi
with Bitcoin is important

558
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:48,587
and it's going to be

559
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,089
super relevant in
the coming years, right?

560
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,191
But if we don't have
distribution, like

561
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,560
no one will know about us
and no one will care

562
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,796
because they don't know
about us. Right?

563
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,631
And so one of the things

564
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,633
that,

565
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,503
it, it suggested, right,
cloud code

566
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:09,107
suggested to me
is to create more content

567
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,910
that centers
around my journey.

568
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:12,344
Right.

569
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,679
And I think blog Face,
you mentioned this, right?

570
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,683
So, just on Monday,
I was officially,

571
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,987
promoted to engineering
manager at Elysium Health.

572
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,021
Right.

573
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,322
Got a nice little pay bump

574
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,191
and, an official title
change. Right.

575
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,627
A long time coming.

576
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,029
But now the the
AI is trying

577
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,532
to suggest that I should
document my journey.

578
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,232
Right?

579
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,967
You know,
where did I go to school?

580
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,638
How did I do, like,
get land internships

581
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,373
in college? Right.

582
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,475
What are my feelings,
thoughts

583
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,910
and interests at the time?

584
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,246
How did I approach
getting a job at agency?

585
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,582
How did I get involved
with Shopify?

586
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:54,419
How did I quickly level up
from a junior developer

587
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,557
to a, a sole contributor
or solo contributor?

588
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,424
Right.

589
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,527
At an agency scale
that up went

590
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,862
into senior positions

591
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,265
and now I'm officially
an engineering manager.

592
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,333
Right.

593
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,835
And so
how does that evolve

594
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,338
into running a team?

595
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,406
Running a company.

596
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,741
And so I don't know.

597
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,342
Yeah.

598
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,612
Can you, just for I get for the can you talk about,

599
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,115
the transition of
you going on your journey

600
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,551
to helping others
go on the journey

601
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,687
because it that's really
the next exciting part.

602
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,189
I think, given your case
studies.

603
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:34,092
Sure.

604
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,827
I mean, I think mentorship

605
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,330
came natural
because, like, ever since

606
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,600
high school, I was already
volunteering, right?

607
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,536
Working with young adults
and high schoolers.

608
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,073
Well, that that was
more like faith based.

609
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,841
But, you know, when you,

610
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,910
every single week,
you're trying to pull out

611
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,012
answers
from high schoolers, so

612
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,313
you get pretty good at it,

613
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,816
even though you suck
in the beginning.

614
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,484
But,

615
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,987
I think from there,

616
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:04,489
it's more of like,

617
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,892
how do I help
in other ways?

618
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:08,893
Right.

619
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,396
And so being able to.

620
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,699
Sort of organize
my own thoughts

621
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,168
and then share it
with someone younger

622
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,637
who's going
through a similar journey.

623
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,707
Can you talk about because

624
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:23,942
essentially
what we're talking about

625
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:27,345
is succession planning
for the stacks ideal hero.

626
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,147
If hero is working
in the business,

627
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,849
he can't work
on the business.

628
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,351
Is that fair? Hero?

629
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:37,055
I mean,
I never look at it

630
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,625
from that way, but,
I just want to,

631
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:43,328
Yeah.

632
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,429
Create more.

633
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,431
The more

634
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,966
capable leaders they are.

635
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,670
An ecosystem doesn't have
to be just an AI guild.

636
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,306
So the so rocket given
you know

637
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,942
what hero wants to do
so of thing off hero.

638
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,612
I just want to nail this
before I forget it.

639
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,881
Brock, you've talked about
your journey.

640
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,949
Can you, 
give me some situation?

641
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,151
Task action results

642
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,653
for the other mentees,
including myself.

643
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:15,727
Situation.

644
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,362
So, I mean,

645
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,763
I think it starts
with, like,

646
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,732
identifying
where you're at right now.

647
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,168
So can you use, like,
Aiden as an example?

648
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,468
Right.

649
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:26,304
Sure.

650
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,874
So I mean,
with Aiden, he,

651
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,744
I mean, I met him when
he was like, what, 17?

652
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,812
Right?

653
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:36,114
He still in high school
trying to figure out

654
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,549
what he wants
to do with college

655
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,652
and him himself
being a techie,

656
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:41,553
like he was trying to

657
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,621
decide, like,
do I go to college

658
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:47,559
or do I, like,
hack it out right, and

659
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,227
just do a startup or join

660
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,730
a startup, start working,
do a bootcamp, right?

661
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:54,599
Because college
is very expensive, right?

662
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,570
And he shared with me
that, his dad,

663
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,106
I think his dad works
as a Coast Guard.

664
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,775
And so he gets benefits
like government benefits

665
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,376
through the GI
Bill. Right.

666
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,846
And so as he finishes
community college

667
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,914
pays for that. And there's
like subsidies for that.

668
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,982
If you
go to community college,

669
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,219
he gets paid

670
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:17,222
to go to a university,
which he's doing right

671
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,891
now, like in this
like the next week or two.

672
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,059
Right.

673
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,595
And so I told him that's
like a no brainer, right?

674
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,763
Because,

675
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,298
instead of competing
with all of these other,

676
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,868
like, you know, boot camp
graduates, right,

677
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,536
you'll
actually have a degree.

678
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:35,340
And later on,
if he wants to pursue,

679
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,673
you know,

680
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,575
a master's degree or a PhD

681
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,577
because he's he's
very smart, right.

682
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:41,312
He could do that. Right.

683
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,748
And so I think he thought
about it,

684
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,883
talked with his parents,

685
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,951
and he decided that
I think for him,

686
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,186
I mean, college
makes sense,

687
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,354
especially for two years

688
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,956
out of the four, he's
going to get paid

689
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,959
to go to
and learn stuff right.

690
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,996
So I think him assessing
his current

691
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,498
situation,
the s right in stark,

692
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,501
that painted
a better picture, right?

693
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,736
A more clearer picture
for him

694
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:05,904
to make that decision

695
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,605
because I can help him
through the process.

696
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,707
But I can't make that
decision for him.

697
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,910
Can you do the same thing
for, Christina

698
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,610
and then myself?

699
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,246
Sure.

700
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,949
So the situation for
Christina was that she,

701
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,651
already
had her bachelor's.

702
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,418
When I met her.

703
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,921
I met her through,
like, a family friend.

704
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,758
She was looking for a job
for six months already.

705
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,927
Right? And no luck. Right.

706
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,764
And so, the family
friend, you know,

707
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,467
I recently helped to land
a job,

708
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,169
and so,
like, word got around,

709
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,639
and then I helped my other
friend Kevin land a job

710
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,676
because he already was in
well into his career,

711
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,377
but he did sort of like

712
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,880
a pivot
where the job that he,

713
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,415
like, he,
he was more into, like,

714
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,017
hardware, 
like electric engineering.

715
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,819
And he wanted to switch
to software

716
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,855
even though he had like a
bachelor's degree in CSS.

717
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,589
Right.

718
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,657
But when you, 
most of your,

719
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,126
like, your,
resume is like hardware.

720
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,262
It's a little hard
to switch to software

721
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,964
when I'm doing that
pivot right.

722
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,933
And so helping him, like,
you know, going through

723
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:09,868
the star method,

724
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,370
like practicing
your interviews, right.

725
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,006
Really nailing down,
answering the question of,

726
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,274
tell me about yourself.

727
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:16,641
Right.

728
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,977
Like, I think that just
little difference

729
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,278
when you start out
really strong

730
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,846
in the interview
that helped him

731
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:24,215
land is your first
and so is your your first

732
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,151
and your most your first
and your last answer.

733
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,621
Because of the primacy
and recency effect,

734
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,923
it's probably something
that's very ignored

735
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:32,857
in interview coaching.

736
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,860
Yeah, I,

737
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,829
I think once they nail
that, it's

738
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,197
it makes it easy
like the rest

739
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,699
of the interview
so much easier.

740
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,201
Just figuring out
your beginning

741
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,469
and how to end strong.

742
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,770
Right. Get to next steps.

743
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,273
So and myself.

744
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,410
And for yourself,
I mean, yeah, I met

745
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,913
we met, here on spaces
because you were.

746
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,581
I was trying to find a job
through you

747
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,282
at that time.

748
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,750
It three years ago.

749
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,784
Yeah. Right.

750
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:03,521
And so, I mean, it was a
give and take, right?

751
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,956
Like I was learning
from you, right?

752
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:05,123
Yeah.

753
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,691
It's time
you were learning for me

754
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:08,326
on the coding side. Right.

755
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,462
And at the time, like, GPT
didn't

756
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,098
even really release yet
when we first met,

757
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,702
I think like shortly
after GPT released,

758
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,371
right, like three
GPT three.

759
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:24,242
Gosh, we're we're to you
two versions in the past.

760
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,210
Right. And so,

761
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,847
I mean, at that time,
we were just talking about

762
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,049
doing a hackathon, right?

763
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,551
And so that's where
how GPT

764
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,120
and the build
a thon sort of method

765
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,290
and event structure
kind of started.

766
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:40,258
Right?

767
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,026
Well, that all started

768
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,094
because
I stuck around this

769
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,496
because I knew I was bad
at sales.

770
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:46,164
Right.

771
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,666
And I wanted to learn from
you how to do sales.

772
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,002
And so, the book. Right.

773
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:54,572
I think it was after, 
after my grandpa

774
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,742
passed, right, that,
that that December.

775
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:58,543
Right.

776
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,278
He passed
and then January,

777
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,879
I was like, okay,
I want to commit.

778
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,815
I was telling myself
I was going to I'll,

779
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,749
I always tell myself, I'm

780
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,751
going to read these books
and I never do.

781
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:07,585
Right.

782
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,453
So I think making

783
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,587
that commitment is like,

784
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,256
hey, I'm actually going to
read these books, right?

785
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:12,757
I'm actually

786
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,826
I'm going to use
AI to prompt it

787
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,561
and actually put it
into practice.

788
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,428
Right.

789
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,465
I think that made a huge
difference, right?

790
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:25,470
Using the PRD method,
using like spin

791
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,840
selling is, is a custom
GPT already, right?

792
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:29,774
It's not.

793
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,209
You know, I didn't even
have to make that.

794
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,477
It's already available.

795
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:35,013
And so using that
for all of our,

796
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,482
all of our calls,
all of our meetings,

797
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:37,849
and then

798
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,083
that really helped

799
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,020
get me to where I am today
as engineering manager.

800
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,489
So I'm going to ask you to

801
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,224
finish off the story
about myself,

802
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,792
because you understand
how I've gone

803
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,761
from front end,
the back end to full

804
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,030
apps now,
and now I'm using Haskell.

805
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,400
But then, 
I'd also ask you, after

806
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,269
the finishing of the story
about myself and my,

807
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,139
development roadmap,

808
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,641
how you're thinking about

809
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,645
going
from mentoring individuals

810
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,349
to if you were in charge
of stacks

811
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:11,816
because of

812
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,886
what you know about DNS
and zero authority,

813
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,755
how we might bring this
all together?

814
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:19,123
Yeah.

815
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,191
So there's like
two parts to that.

816
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:22,293
So first part is
I think your journey.

817
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:22,927
Right.

818
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,395
I mean, I can't take
all the credit.

819
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,863
I mean, Paul,

820
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,066
it's someone
who taught you Python.

821
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,168
I'm like him
for all this chaos. Yes,

822
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:31,736
but he's going to

823
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,238
get a tractor
soon, so. Yes,

824
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:35,773
we got him. What?

825
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,642
Exactly
what he wanted, and more.

826
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,911
So, yeah,

827
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,814
we can't wait to see him
with his tractor.

828
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:43,414
It'll be fine.

829
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,084
Hey, and the other person,
who shall remain

830
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,552
nameless, has a house now.

831
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,253
And your house.

832
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,822
Wow. Okay. Yeah.

833
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,057
You did close on a task,
right? Right? Right.

834
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,192
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:54,759
That's true.

836
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,261
That is very true.

837
00:34:58,563 --> 00:34:58,796
Yeah.

838
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,998
So keep going. 
Don't take up.

839
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:02,133
You can't take
all the credit,

840
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,169
because Paul for me,
Python and but continue

841
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,672
because, you know, you.

842
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,074
Oh, if Oma is
great at back end,

843
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,409
you're great at front end.

844
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,911
And you help me actually
do these integration

845
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,514
of those two.

846
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:16,781
Yeah.

847
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:21,652
I mean, I think the, the
creation of like GPT 3.5.

848
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,053
Right.

849
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,288
Doing the build of thought
because we could have

850
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,458
like when we spend a ton
of hours on spaces, right.

851
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,595
Less now than, than
when we first started.

852
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,331
I think that all started
because we were

853
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,900
part of the,
you know, evil plan.

854
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,802
And his his, yes,
you know,

855
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,537
ongoing spaces last cycle.

856
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:40,338
Right.

857
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,907
Meeting all those people
there was very helpful.

858
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,010
Like all pretty much
most of the DeFi

859
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:47,512
knowledge that I know

860
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,014
today was from agencies
with Evil plan.

861
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,683
And I met you through
Eric who introduced.

862
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:52,884
Yeah.

863
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:55,286
Yeah.

864
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,654
And and we still talk

865
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,855
to some of those people
today.

866
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:58,456
Right. Like there.

867
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:01,425
So you know they might not
be in spaces as often

868
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,493
but they still jump on

869
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,862
every now and we catch up
with them. Right.

870
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,732
And so I think

871
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,234
for your journey,

872
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:13,237
doing the build of fans
really, really helped

873
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,140
because it like actually
focused our energy

874
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,043
instead of just talking
about ideas all day.

875
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,244
We actually put

876
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,547
like, people
put money on the line.

877
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,381
Right?

878
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:26,384
It started with $10
and then it was 100

879
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,753
and then into the
thousands. Right.

880
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,522
And then, you know,

881
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,125
the whole project
with, Doctor Wetzel.

882
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:34,859
Right.

883
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,362
Like we basically got
someone paid

884
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,232
the level who works
for the US government

885
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,768
to show up to our like,
that's

886
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,002
that was pretty cool.

887
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,537
Okay. So it's really cool.

888
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,872
And he wasn't
the first celebrity

889
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,740
to show up
at these spaces.

890
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,775
Yeah.

891
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,311
And I learned a lot
from those faces.

892
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,478
Right. Oh, yeah.

893
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:58,082
And sure, like,
I think like they got a,

894
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,718
like, we didn't
get to the finish line

895
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,553
for some of the projects.
Okay.

896
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,957
But we learned a lot in
like throughout

897
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,425
the journey. Right.

898
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,393
And that's pretty typical

899
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,962
with like startup culture.
Right.

900
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,931
Is not to get
sort of disappointed and

901
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,834
sort of dejected
from the failures.

902
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,435
Right.

903
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,337
Just focus on
what we actually learned.

904
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,271
And we learned a lot

905
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,774
like it was the first time
that I learned about,

906
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:27,144
like, was it, common
graph complexity?

907
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,412
Was it? Right?

908
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:29,814
Right.

909
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,082
Well, actually.

910
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,049
So, I

911
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,652
want to really nail this
because I believe that

912
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,455
the future of any guild

913
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,157
is build a thons, right?

914
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,359
You know how we're doing

915
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,526
our sprints

916
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,128
and one hour,
our Google venture

917
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,697
design sprints with you
and sometimes

918
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,499
and how we'll be there
in the background.

919
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,401
That's the future,
I think, of

920
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:54,005
intentional collaboration
with definable outcomes.

921
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,273
Give it that work expands

922
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,841
to fill the time allotted.

923
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,742
Can you talk about.

924
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:58,943
It's something
we haven't talked about.

925
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,310
Yeah.

926
00:37:59,310 --> 00:37:59,910
Sorry.

927
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,413
Was bring this on you
back.

928
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,216
You didn't have a job

929
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,419
before the build a phone,
but you got one after.

930
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,888
Yeah. Right.

931
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,391
But what changed?

932
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:17,361
Well GPT 3.5 coming out.

933
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,664
Definitely say more.

934
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:20,531
Say more about that.

935
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,034
Sure. So,

936
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,871
so another another

937
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,340
sort of like, career
coach that I follow,

938
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,109
online.

939
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,278
He was talking about,
like,

940
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,815
the way that you get
promoted quickly

941
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:38,449
and like, by

942
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,951
your manager is to make
his life easier.

943
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,086
Right?

944
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:42,987
And it's not to just

945
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,022
follow everything
that he does. Right.

946
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,524
Because they're busy.

947
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:46,891
Right.

948
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:49,026
And for myself, like,

949
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,261
I mean,
I have a girlfriend

950
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,362
and I have to spend time
with her,

951
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,331
but I don't have, like,
kids, right.

952
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,199
I don't have
kids of my own.

953
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,635
I don't have to, like,
spend time with kids.

954
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,236
I don't have, like.

955
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,672
Like, my parents
aren't, like, all.

956
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,374
And I have to take care
of them, right?

957
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,444
But for him, like,
he probably has parents

958
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,411
like my manager. Right?

959
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,880
He has parents. The
he has to take care of.

960
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,782
He has young kids.
He has to take care of.

961
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:12,516
He doesn't have time

962
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,853
to freaking read
like all these AI updates.

963
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,520
Right.

964
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,023
And and stay up to date
with,

965
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,592
you know,
whatever GPT model is out

966
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,527
and whatever
tool is available, right.

967
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:25,830
And so

968
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,232
I really started with
doing the build with on

969
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,402
and learning pretty much
everything that we could

970
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,372
in the two weeks that
we did the build phone.

971
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,206
Right.

972
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,307
Not even two weeks or far,

973
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,576
like a weekend
plus like five days.

974
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,009
Right.

975
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:41,512
So like a week
that we learned to really

976
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:46,550
nail down what, what
the ins and outs

977
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,487
and the weaknesses
right, of GPT 3.5.

978
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,489
And then
during the interview,

979
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,557
I just talked
about my projects

980
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,759
and what we did for
the build, the timeline

981
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,495
and everything I knew
about ChatGPT for pretty

982
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,997
much like 40 minutes
out of the hour

983
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,799
during the interview,
right? Sure.

984
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,000
We went the the normal.

985
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,703
Tell me about yourself,
talk about my career,

986
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,538
what my plans are
for the future,

987
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,939
why I'm interested
in the company.

988
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,641
Right. Typical behavior.

989
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,643
Questions
for an interview.

990
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,912
And then he asked about
my personal projects,

991
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,180
and I was like, sure,
I'm doing,

992
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,782
you know, I started
this build a farm,

993
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,483
this group on X, right?

994
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,551
He was very interested,

995
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,819
and I just talked about

996
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,188
that for the rest
of the interview. Right.

997
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,791
And even
throughout the job,

998
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:30,861
all these updates for AI
and how we can use it

999
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,364
at the company,
like I'm basically,

1000
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,066
you know, unofficially
chief AI officer

1001
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,669
at the company because
no one knows what to do.

1002
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,705
The updates
are super fast.

1003
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:42,640
It's like every week.

1004
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,774
They're, you know, each

1005
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,277
knowing what to do
is not a trivial thing.

1006
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,745
And if you're not
confused,

1007
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,046
you're not paying
attention.

1008
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:52,082
Can you say more about
just how difficult it is,

1009
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,784
even for very
intelligent people

1010
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,087
because of the pace of
change to actually use it?

1011
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:58,889
Yeah.

1012
00:40:58,889 --> 00:40:59,523
I mean, like

1013
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,027
most of my coworkers,
like, have kids, right?

1014
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,128
Like, I'm probably

1015
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,630
the youngest person
at the company.

1016
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,431
Right.

1017
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,133
And,

1018
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,468
you know, I,
I'm trying to put myself

1019
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,303
in their shoes, like,
you know, when you're busy

1020
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,571
just doing life things

1021
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,841
right, you don't have time
to consistently and,

1022
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,777
you know, almost to
to the point of abuse,

1023
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,848
like prompt to cloud code
right down to your life.

1024
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,649
Like,
that's not a normal thing

1025
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,684
that people do.

1026
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:27,117
Yeah.

1027
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:30,321
Normal people
aren't up at 5:38 a.m.

1028
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:30,855
trying to

1029
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,691
create a real package.json
for the railway

1030
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,192
hackathon at 12 p.m..

1031
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,529
Yeah, and

1032
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,597
so like, it's not

1033
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:39,930
about like

1034
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,632
sharing everything
that I do

1035
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,334
because a lot of
the things I do like,

1036
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,735
they fail. Right.

1037
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,370
But the things
that are successful,

1038
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,371
I do use them as

1039
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:50,040
suggestions
to my, my manager.

1040
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,975
Right.

1041
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,078
And then some of that
gets, you know,

1042
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,448
it moves up
the chain of command.

1043
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:57,715
Right?

1044
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,984
And it makes its way
to our CEO. Right.

1045
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,086
Because he has the time.

1046
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,355
And that's like his entire
job, right?

1047
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,490
You know,

1048
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,759
so using the signal
processing

1049
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,196
filtering system
for the executive team

1050
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,698
and peers and then
and the subordinates.

1051
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:15,566
Yeah.

1052
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,468
So, it kind of goes
both ways.

1053
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,204
So like I'm doing more of
like the day to day

1054
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,407
ground work discovery
right into

1055
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,310
whether it's AI or machine
learning systems.

1056
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,945
Right, or Shopify.

1057
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:28,145
Right.

1058
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,648
Because that makes
all of our money right.

1059
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,218
While so that's like
bottom up, right.

1060
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,988
And then top down, our CEO
and I think most CEOs,

1061
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,392
right, are looking at
the release of GPT five.

1062
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,726
What is Google's response?

1063
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,961
What is meta doing?

1064
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,096
Do I use AI right.

1065
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,599
And how do you I use this
to make more money

1066
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,101
for my investors
because most companies

1067
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,970
have stakeholders, right?

1068
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,370
And I don't

1069
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,371
how do I

1070
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,007
architect these systems
such that migrating

1071
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,743
to a new paradigm
is not a transformation

1072
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,179
that takes billions
of dollars and 18 months?

1073
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:03,981
I mean,

1074
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,318
it's expensive to adopt
any new technology, right?

1075
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:11,655
As well
as, if you choose the

1076
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,557
wrong one, it's
very costly.

1077
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:13,891
Right.

1078
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:14,792
We're making budgeting

1079
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,827
decisions right now
in the WhatsApp. Okay.

1080
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,696
What are we going to do?
So. Right.

1081
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:23,334
So, can you now again
start to do this?

1082
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,538
Can you talk about
just how fundamentally,

1083
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,942
the code is changing
your workflow

1084
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,712
and specifically
for the stack saying, Gil,

1085
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,281
can you talk about
the process

1086
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,550
of how you created
the video

1087
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,420
that we just created above
using the filmmaker

1088
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,855
context engineering

1089
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,491
with Cloud code
to develop the Json

1090
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,327
for the video
for Midjourney?

1091
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,663
Well,
I think it just started

1092
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,032
with like, me
wanting to make,

1093
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:59,203
so so we're doing like
a pitch for at least I.

1094
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,170
Right.

1095
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,473
It's going to be like
a health

1096
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,974
and wellness
companion, right?

1097
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,311
Tool, and it's going to be
customer facing,

1098
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,681
that we're we're looking
at release in in January.

1099
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,282
Right. And

1100
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:13,851
I wanted to

1101
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,587
make better, website
assets.

1102
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:17,087
Right.

1103
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,322
So in, in front end

1104
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,824
development or,
web design,

1105
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:21,759
you know,

1106
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,594
you know, those,
those boxes, those square

1107
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,695
rectangular boxes

1108
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:25,095
and have

1109
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:25,896
it has like

1110
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:26,730
a little bit of text,

1111
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,598
but there's usually like

1112
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:31,268
some kind of illustration
or, some kind of video

1113
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,803
that's like background
video that's playing

1114
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,438
or some animation
that's playing.

1115
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:36,640
So that if you want
a prompt

1116
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,843
for this, it's called,
like a bento box, right.

1117
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,246
Or a bento section. Right.

1118
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,314
And so those sections,

1119
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,151
if you're really good
at designing,

1120
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,819
you're going to animate
these things, right?

1121
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,087
Usually in After Effects.

1122
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,588
And it's very time

1123
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,091
consuming and expensive
to do it.

1124
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,092
Right.

1125
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,095
And so I was having
trouble prompting it.

1126
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,731
And, you know, that

1127
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,467
specific example
is not for the bento box.

1128
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:03,834
Right.

1129
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,236
But I
was having some trouble

1130
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,107
crafting the
prompts for Midjourney,

1131
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,077
right where it would look
good and, you know,

1132
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,579
good enough, right,
for an MVP, right?

1133
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,083
Because
this is potentially,

1134
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,151
that landing page
would potentially allocate

1135
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,687
anywhere between 200
and 50 K to half

1136
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,323
$1 million
of internal investments,

1137
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,026
right from the CEO
and the CFO.

1138
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:29,526
Right.

1139
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,629
Because I'm essentially
asking for funds

1140
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,132
internally
to do this project.

1141
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,134
Right.

1142
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,136
And so if we're going to
ask for a quarter million

1143
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,237
to half $1 million,

1144
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,806
it's going to have to look
pretty damn good, right?

1145
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,908
It's gonna look
it has to look convincing.

1146
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,979
And so we just Midjourney

1147
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,582
has a lot of nuances,
right?

1148
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:52,983
That may or may not be

1149
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,219
different from other
prompting tools. Right.

1150
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,587
And I was struggling
with that.

1151
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,023
And so, I mean, the idea
came from you, Michael.

1152
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,460
Right, is let's figure out
let's write a tool

1153
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,261
to help me

1154
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,998
write the Json right,
to dump into Midjourney.

1155
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,801
So let's not like
prompt it,

1156
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,303
manually because I'm
not a film director

1157
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,371
and you know that.

1158
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,839
Remind us.

1159
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,173
Yeah.

1160
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:16,974
And, you know,

1161
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,242
I was asking
you and you're like,

1162
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,877
I don't know, you know,
right.

1163
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,078
Let's
fucking have planets.

1164
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:22,613
Yeah.

1165
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,249
And and so, you know, we
we kind of like,

1166
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:29,386
you know co prompted
madness and GPT

1167
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,155
and came up with the Json

1168
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,625
structure to give us a way
to better direct video.

1169
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:35,058
Right.

1170
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:38,395
And so that came about
because we were trying

1171
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:41,131
to come up with ideas
for the current,

1172
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,834
CTC.

1173
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,570
Like hackathon
that's going on.

1174
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,105
So we're a part of that.

1175
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,007
We're doing that
on Dora Hacks.

1176
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,643
I think the the end date
is September 4th.

1177
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,346
But yeah, we'll see
if we can use these tools

1178
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:58,382
to make a cool
landing page,

1179
00:46:58,382 --> 00:46:59,850
you know,
do some marketing

1180
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,220
and then actually create
the, the payment gateway

1181
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,123
with Sbdc
with, cloud code.

1182
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,194
So in we're
going to come to that,

1183
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,696
but I want to have
some overlap.

1184
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,865
What was the

1185
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,202
what was the difference

1186
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,438
between the generated
videos and images

1187
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,941
you got with Midjourney
when you started?

1188
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,511
And after the sprint,
where we developed

1189
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,214
a data structure
to act as a film director,

1190
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,883
what was the change like

1191
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,118
in using in
creating content in videos

1192
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,621
and images
with Midjourney?

1193
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:38,188
Sure.

1194
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,692
So I think I just

1195
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,428
I didn't know
how to describe things.

1196
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:44,728
Right.

1197
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,231
Because I'm not like
a, I'm not I didn't take

1198
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:47,664
I mean,

1199
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,932
I took like
a photography class

1200
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,000
in like high school,
right.

1201
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,602
But I'm not into like
film.

1202
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,737
Just watch
a lot of content. Right.

1203
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:57,274
So I know when the content
looks good, right.

1204
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,610
Because it just consume
a lot of content. Right.

1205
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,277
But I don't really know

1206
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,312
how to describe it
into words.

1207
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,781
And with these, prompt,

1208
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:08,485
like engines, basically,
they only understand

1209
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,786
words, right?

1210
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,322
But but with Midjourney,
it's not just even words.

1211
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,690
It's all of these
parameters

1212
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,325
that you have to know.
Right?

1213
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,160
Like I totally forgot
about Nietzsche.

1214
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,830
So I was like,
oh, if you do not need it.

1215
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,700
And it's like optimize for
like anime style, right?

1216
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,601
Prompts.

1217
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:29,339
Like, how do I do like
camera movements, right?

1218
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,108
I didn't really know
how to describe that.

1219
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,477
And I totally forgot
that you could even,

1220
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,845
in my brain,

1221
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,014
I was putting images
that I generated

1222
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,182
as references
like style references,

1223
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,851
but you could also
just references it

1224
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,053
like through the words
right?

1225
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,821
And so just using things
like,

1226
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,189
you know,
the favorite anime

1227
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,991
that I want
it to look like, right.

1228
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,894
And so,

1229
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,964
being able to describe
things like that without,

1230
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,401
being super specific.

1231
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:57,901
Right?

1232
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,136
I think at some point

1233
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,070
I'll get used to it

1234
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,838
and I'll remember
certain things,

1235
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,341
but I think is a great
tool for beginners, right?

1236
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,142
I mean,

1237
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,643
I think we should just
make to the web apps

1238
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,946
honestly inherent.

1239
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,448
So what was the,

1240
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:15,419
what was the difference
between the, outputs

1241
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,155
that you got before
implementing this cloud

1242
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,691
code film director engine?

1243
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,592
And what was the
difference after

1244
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,361
when you actually did
the outputs?

1245
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:26,830
It's at the top for anyone
who wants to see it.

1246
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,599
I mean, the difference
was huge, right?

1247
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,600
Yeah. Like the other one.

1248
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,803
I can only just do
like simple movements.

1249
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,005
And it wasn't consistent.
Right.

1250
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,840
Like there was one
where I was trying

1251
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,309
to get it to do,
like a drone fly over,

1252
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,911
but I didn't really know
how to describe, like,

1253
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:44,715
I want you to fly,
you know, the drone from

1254
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:48,251
bottom left to like, top
right, right.

1255
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:51,722
And then, you know, still
centering on the object.

1256
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:52,889
Right.

1257
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,358
And it was just like,
inconsistent

1258
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,193
and didn't
look as good. Right.

1259
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,130
So now,
I mean, now it's just

1260
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,699
more consistent
because like the,

1261
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,603
the AI prompt optimizer is
the one taking my words,

1262
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:07,637
my descriptions

1263
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,073
and then structuring it in
a way where

1264
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,075
Midjourney will understand
it best

1265
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,578
and not my understanding
of Midjourney.

1266
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,449
So given that the stacks

1267
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,952
AI guild right now

1268
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,088
has the outcome
of cementing

1269
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,358
as positioning
in the customer's mind

1270
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:32,162
stacks as the dominant
layer two in Bitcoin,

1271
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:36,033
how can you share
with others

1272
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:40,037
how you've used cloud code
with context engineering

1273
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:44,674
to create better outputs
with Midjourney?

1274
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:47,177
Good will video,
what have you.

1275
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,847
I mean, I think I just
have to just post more.

1276
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,650
I mean, I think
the both of you posted.

1277
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,318
Yeah, right.

1278
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:57,687
I think, I mean,
I think I need to like

1279
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,157
maybe part of linear
is like actually

1280
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,759
having a social project,
like a social media

1281
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,595
where I dedicate time

1282
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,464
to actually posts
consistently.

1283
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,498
Right?

1284
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,500
Because people
only see your effects

1285
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,969
through me and Aiden
and Cristine. Right.

1286
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,071
Does that make sense?

1287
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:14,337
Yeah.

1288
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,106
Like they see
a lot of your work

1289
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,809
through other people
in the syndicate.

1290
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:20,911
Yeah.

1291
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,013
I mean, I think now that,
you know,

1292
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,515
finally got that
official title. Yes.

1293
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,284
I don't have to worry
as much now.

1294
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,051
It's just

1295
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,153
I just got to cruise
for at least six months.

1296
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,021
Right?

1297
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,789
If I wanted to hop,
I probably could.

1298
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,257
I really like it
here. Right?

1299
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,093
I don't really plan to hop
anytime soon.

1300
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:36,893
Right.

1301
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:41,465
But, Nah,
I think now is pretty

1302
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:44,468
much the time to, the
how do you say it?

1303
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:47,471
To, to

1304
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,941
what is it
to come out of stealth?

1305
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,842
Yeah.

1306
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,043
Emerge from stealth.

1307
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,412
Emerge from stealth? Yes.

1308
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,081
I think,
if there was ever a time

1309
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,951
for you as an individual
to emerge from stealth,

1310
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,587
now wouldn't
be the worst time.

1311
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,289
You're not just
a front end developer.

1312
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,525
No offense.
You know what I mean?

1313
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,994
And I say that
from the perception

1314
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:14,297
of statuses on the,
you know, kind of thing.

1315
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:18,268
You have
a bit of status now.

1316
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,476
It'll take a little time
to kick in.

1317
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,845
I'm sure you'll come.

1318
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,081
And then you can,

1319
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,183
you know, eventually
become uncle Bob.

1320
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,418
You know,
that be the long arc.

1321
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,120
Okay, great.

1322
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,623
So going back, let's
put a fine point on it.

1323
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:44,094
The purpose of this tax
ideal is to secure

1324
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,763
the positioning of stocks
in the magic

1325
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,100
Quadrant for Gartner,

1326
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,602
for lay
or choose on Bitcoin.

1327
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:55,272
Is that fair?

1328
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,909
I want to know what hero
thinks.

1329
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,777
Is that fair? Hero?

1330
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,280
Is that
what we're going for?

1331
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,362
I mean, one of the things,

1332
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,432
that I want to see
from the other artists,

1333
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:25,435
too, and, sax AI Guild is

1334
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,270
I would like to see
their process.

1335
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,971
Right.

1336
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,273
Maybe one of them has
a really cool tool that we

1337
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,776
don't know about that
often prompts.

1338
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:33,743
Well,

1339
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,312
one of the great things is
three

1340
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,680
Hana has been posting

1341
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,182
videos
through the organize media

1342
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,951
which this process.

1343
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:41,351
So you can

1344
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,853
imagine what we can do
with that data set.

1345
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,456
In addition
to this conversation,

1346
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:50,093
one of
the key things that is,

1347
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:51,995
going to

1348
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,931
take us tax
ideals to the next level

1349
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:58,301
is to turn a collection
of individuals into a

1350
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,804
network of individuals.

1351
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,072
Does that make sense?

1352
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,940
Just like you and I
and the rest of the team

1353
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,443
are networks to GitHub.

1354
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,733
I can combine

1355
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:32,235
this conversation today

1356
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:36,006
with 300 transcripts
from the organize media

1357
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,843
to start
building a curriculum.

1358
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,979
No hierarchy in back.

1359
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,218
You can keep going.

1360
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,120
I've already hit my hour
limit for today.

1361
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,855
Yeah, yeah. Thank.

1362
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,757
It's like you're on
air too long.

1363
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:55,792
It's okay. So,

1364
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,029
now to return to
where we were initially.

1365
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,864
The reason
I open this space.

1366
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:04,267
It's actually not stacks
related.

1367
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,971
But it is member
audio box.

1368
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,106
Not fun.

1369
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,575
I do remember that

1370
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:16,313
experiment we did to
use code to create music.

1371
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,650
Yeah,
with, frisky fisticuffs.

1372
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,052
Right? Yeah.

1373
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:26,156
So remember how I told you
I learned, how

1374
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,559
to kind of think
and programing Haskell

1375
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,796
with a matrix?

1376
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,298
So I was like, oh,

1377
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:39,002
so you're saying that
Haskell is a better tool

1378
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,504
for state management,

1379
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,174
than other paradigms?

1380
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,942
And, grok said, yeah.

1381
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,511
So I was like, all right,
now that is a matrix.

1382
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,781
You know how I have
Geometry of Music

1383
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:55,185
and create remixes
by arranging songs?

1384
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,353
Okay. Yeah.

1385
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,355
I remember
you wanted to make a tool

1386
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,789
and give people access
to that

1387
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,057
as part of your teaching,
right?

1388
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,093
Of geometry, of music.

1389
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,595
I have it working
now for a single song.

1390
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,831
Nice.

1391
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,834
Katy Perry's
Harleys in Hawaii.

1392
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,136
You'll understand this.

1393
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,971
You're familiar
with a chord progression.

1394
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,541
You're
familiar that most songs

1395
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,011
consist of a repeat of the
same chord progression

1396
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,313
over and over again?

1397
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,447
Yeah, pretty much
just shift

1398
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:28,118
it between verse, chorus,
bridge, B chorus, bridge.

1399
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,853
All right. Intro.

1400
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:30,120
Yeah.

1401
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,087
I mean, most of the songs
don't

1402
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,422
even have bridges
or tags anymore.

1403
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:32,889
No, no,

1404
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,359
it's like chorus, chorus,
maybe a verse and then.

1405
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:36,760
Yeah.

1406
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,263
Is the TikTok
ification of music, right?

1407
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,300
So, but what if we took

1408
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:47,937
every 16 or 32 bars

1409
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,473
of the vocals

1410
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,110
as bricks, vocal bricks,

1411
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,881
and we rearranged
and layered and

1412
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:01,618
create multi layers

1413
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,386
of vocal bricks

1414
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,889
that went over
the same instrumental.

1415
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,259
That's
what I have right now.

1416
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,896
So I have it for Katy
Perry's Hawaii

1417
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,732
generated about 5
to 8 different remixes.

1418
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,368
Now what
I'm going to do is

1419
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,538
I'm going
to use myself, the human,

1420
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,673
to take the best parts

1421
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,142
of those remixes
and create a final one,

1422
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:30,113
because a lot
of the opinions on AGI,

1423
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,949
AI is an AI that works
without human input.

1424
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,985
But I believe that
no AI is complete

1425
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,055
without the signal
processing

1426
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,025
of humans interacting
with each other

1427
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,328
to document the song piece
that cannot be

1428
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,031
necessarily structured

1429
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,266
or communicated

1430
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,601
in text.

1431
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,103
My eyes crawling
data alone.

1432
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:55,405
Does that make sense?

1433
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:56,439
So I'm purposefully

1434
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:58,942
inserting myself
in the process.

1435
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,846
Yeah, I think
when we talk about AGI

1436
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,615
we have to define
like our definition of it.

1437
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:06,516
I think

1438
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:10,353
the VC definition of AGI
is that you know, open AI,

1439
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,121
they're going to link AGI,
right?

1440
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,324
Google.
They're going to make AGI.

1441
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,459
And they have to say that
they're going to

1442
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:17,093
they're not going to say

1443
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:20,330
so AGI is actually
a complex network of

1444
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,831
networks
right next to that.

1445
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:24,934
Their stock is going to

1446
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,437
drop because the thesis is
not that.

1447
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:32,108
Their thesis is I'm going
to help you fire people.

1448
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:34,978
My thesis
is I'm going to help you

1449
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,381
allocate
your human capital

1450
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:42,452
more strategically now
that we have a new tool

1451
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,421
to take the burden of,

1452
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,491
if them thinking off
their hands.

1453
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,628
We're seeing this play out
with,

1454
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:55,365
with, like L2 too,
right?

1455
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:58,167
Like, like circle
is creating their own

1456
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,604
aetherium L2 like tether
is doing their own L2.

1457
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:02,605
Pretty much

1458
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:05,108
all the major things
I want to do there.

1459
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:07,310
So you're saying
we're going to have

1460
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,812
the basic application
of L2

1461
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,815
where the exchanges
create their own L2?

1462
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,485
I mean, it's

1463
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,353
it was like it's
very similar instance

1464
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,889
in the 2000s
when everyone wanted

1465
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,391
to create their own
internet.

1466
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:21,691
Right?

1467
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,059
The narrative back
then was like,

1468
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,062
oh, internets will be
the best thing ever,

1469
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:28,831
and it will be
the internet as a whole,

1470
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,101
because private is better,
safer, right?

1471
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,737
Faster, cheaper. Right?

1472
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,140
That did become the case.

1473
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,642
Like the whole internet
as a whole

1474
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,145
is much, much bigger
and much more valuable

1475
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:45,248
than any single internet
that a single company

1476
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,282
can create.

1477
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:46,449
I mean,

1478
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,517
I guess,
I guess you could say

1479
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:48,084
that in certain

1480
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,920
countries, Facebook
is their internet, right?

1481
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:51,988
I don't think that's
the only

1482
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,389
way that they get access.

1483
00:59:59,028 --> 00:59:59,262
Yeah.

1484
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,430
So that's the net net

1485
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,700
of my, explorations
right now with Haskell,

1486
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,803
I was able to go from,

1487
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,639
you know, creating
applications with back

1488
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:12,141
ends of Python,
flask, Django

1489
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:16,512
to an end to rust, Tmax.

1490
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,515
And now I'm starting
to think

1491
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,452
in Haskell,

1492
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,421
like I'm
talking about pre pre.

1493
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:28,091
I think in Haskell

1494
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:30,660
create the groups
and the monoids

1495
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,262
and the functors and the
objects and the entities.

1496
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,164
And then let's create
the pod

1497
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,666
that's faithful to that.

1498
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:40,169
Using the Haskell program
as a way to

1499
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:42,905
logically evaluate

1500
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,042
what we're asking,
what we're proposing.

1501
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,412
Yeah I think yeah,
I think you're on the

1502
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:50,113
wrong blockchain.

1503
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,615
You sound more
and more like a card.

1504
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,450
Yeah. Sorry. Okay.

1505
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,185
So actually
that's another thing.

1506
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,754
So Cardano
has a hackathon.

1507
01:00:57,754 --> 01:01:00,289
So we're going to be
submitting to that, right?

1508
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,025
I think this,

1509
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,428
because the other
thing, I'm looking at you

1510
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,930
is the reason I'm
starting with Haskell is

1511
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:13,036
I, I didn't execute
the solution in the end.

1512
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,837
And Haskell,

1513
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:17,340
I had the Haskell
developer

1514
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,777
talk to the Python
developer

1515
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,379
in the presence

1516
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,882
of the product manager,

1517
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,917
and I ended up having

1518
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,953
the Python developer
complete the task.

1519
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,188
Does that make sense?

1520
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,757
So a thought in Haskell.

1521
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,226
But then it executed in
Python

1522
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,128
and I have
the whole conversation.

1523
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,631
So now I'm
speaking in rules.

1524
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:42,899
Make sense?

1525
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:43,332
I used to

1526
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:46,736
just speak 1 to 1 as
if ChatGPT was one person.

1527
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,539
Now I'm saying we're going
to have a conference

1528
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,608
simulate a conversation.

1529
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,614
See, this is why

1530
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:03,052
I want to be able to like,
have like shared

1531
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,121
kind of like program

1532
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,623
like code
programing or paragraphs,

1533
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:10,460
but in a prompt sense,
right?

1534
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,795
Like like I wanted it.

1535
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:14,297
So I so far

1536
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,833
it's one of the reasons
why I love granola.

1537
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:17,800
Right.

1538
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,937
The the meeting recorder
and transcriber.

1539
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:24,540
It's because I could live
prompt granola.

1540
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:25,708
Right.

1541
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,077
Have it
come up with questions,

1542
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,345
have it come,
you know, make me sound

1543
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,847
smart or whatever.

1544
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,148
Sometimes,
most of the time

1545
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:34,016
it's probably, like,
not useful, right?

1546
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,585
Like,
I probably have better

1547
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,855
contacts, right,
than granola itself,

1548
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:40,223
but it

1549
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,859
it direct me in the right
path, and that's

1550
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,361
really all I really need
the tool to do.

1551
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,063
Just point
me in the right direction.

1552
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:54,303
And the other engineers
love it, by the way,

1553
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,206
because I post the recaps
into our slack channels.

1554
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,407
I love it.

1555
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,009
Yeah,

1556
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:02,311
people who can't show up,
they appreciate it

1557
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,880
or they have to have
early.

1558
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,981
They like the recap,

1559
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,650
and the people who stay,
you know, are able

1560
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,153
to prompt it as well
when I post it.

1561
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:10,920
If they, like,

1562
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,256
don't understand
something that I said.

1563
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,292
That is a key part
where I realize that

1564
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:20,062
if we're going to become
better as a team, it's

1565
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,764
the network effects
between us,

1566
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,066
which is
now driven to GitHub

1567
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,103
because I can post repos
and now you have my repos

1568
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:31,073
with the full readings,
but I'm writing a read me

1569
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,744
intended for an Ela lab

1570
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:35,845
because I know you're

1571
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,247
not going to fucking
look at the code.

1572
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:39,482
You're going to have cloud
code,

1573
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,383
look at the code and

1574
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,684
and from cloud code

1575
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:42,919
to tell you
about the GitHub

1576
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,454
and the project structure
and the key files.

1577
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,891
So I'm also thinking about
the developer experience

1578
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,092
which is mediated by an.

1579
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,007
Hey maybe
we can make this tool.

1580
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,776
How do how do we do
pair pair

1581
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,278
prompting with cloud code.

1582
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:13,115
So so what I'm going to do
for example,

1583
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,185
is I'm going to, export
this full chat.

1584
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,589
I have a few ways of kind
of investigating this,

1585
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,692
you know, just kind of
exploring the space.

1586
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:23,559
But right now

1587
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,128
I have a conference
between a product manager,

1588
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:29,232
the Haskell person,
and the Python person.

1589
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,668
So I'm getting used to

1590
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,504
coordinating
between agents.

1591
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:38,007
That makes sense.

1592
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,543
There's the task master.

1593
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,579
So, you know, 
what's going to happen

1594
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:44,247
is I'm going to

1595
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,083
get that code today
or tomorrow, right.

1596
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,052
And there's going to be
an explosion.

1597
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,621
So to end this
conversation off,

1598
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:52,722
which is good,

1599
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:53,923
can you talk about
how we're going

1600
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,425
to interact in the future
using linear

1601
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,894
and how different that is

1602
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,762
from how we're interacting
right now?

1603
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,063
What's happened

1604
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,032
that is the key
inflection point for us.

1605
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:05,768
Sure.

1606
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:08,271
I mean,
eventually I don't think

1607
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,039
we're going to stop
using WhatsApp.

1608
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,975
I think we need to use
cloud code to make

1609
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:15,278
some kind of plug
in for WhatsApp.

1610
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,412
So like we can do
something

1611
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,548
like, slash Claude,
you know, take this

1612
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,151
to summarize our last hour

1613
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,120
into a list of action
items.

1614
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,222
We just directly in
WhatsApp. Right.

1615
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:28,724
And then push to linear
as tickets.

1616
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,626
And we can do things
like that now,

1617
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,795
which is pretty
was pretty cool.

1618
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,898
Other other things
that I'm doing

1619
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,467
with cloud code
is, for work.

1620
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,137
I'll have a session
with it where it's like

1621
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:44,273
it'll come up
with like a plan MD right?

1622
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,341
And then it's like, okay,

1623
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:46,709
take this actually came

1624
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,878
from my manager,
by the way.

1625
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,212
So I'm
sharing ideas with him,

1626
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:51,881
and then he's coming up
with his own workflows

1627
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,716
and sharing it
with everybody else.

1628
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,151
Let me let me
you're going to

1629
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:55,751
share what he did.

1630
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:59,155
So step one is you use
cloud to write a PRD,

1631
01:05:59,522 --> 01:05:59,989
right.

1632
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:02,358
Have it asks you at least
ten questions.

1633
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,560
You answer it,
you provide requirements,

1634
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,263
maybe code
snippets, entire code base

1635
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,799
constraints,
write security measures,

1636
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,502
and then you ask it
to decompose the PRD

1637
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:14,837
into sprints.

1638
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,340
And so our sprints are
two weeks, two weeks long.

1639
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,608
Monday
through Friday. Right.

1640
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:22,011
If you want,
I give it context

1641
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,146
where Friday
is typically lighter

1642
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,348
because
some of our contractors

1643
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,849
don't work on Fridays.
Right.

1644
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:29,185
So it's going to issue
last tickets

1645
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,420
around Thursday
and Friday. Right.

1646
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,457
And then step three
is to take the sprints

1647
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,093
and make a to do DMD.

1648
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,763
Breaking the sprints down
into individual task.

1649
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:44,333
If tasks are complex
and have a high

1650
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:49,405
number
for story points, right.

1651
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,340
Create

1652
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,843
subtask within those task.

1653
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:54,710
Right.

1654
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,213
And then you can even

1655
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:59,915
it's depending on the
task, you can even issue

1656
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:03,853
that to do
task two clawed sub agents

1657
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,188
to do the writing
and stuff for you

1658
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:06,922
and then dump it

1659
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:10,493
into another markdown file
or some kind of code.

1660
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:11,861
Right.

1661
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,363
And then you just repeat
and do that

1662
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,532
whenever you have
a new set of work to do.

1663
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,035
So I mean, that's, that's
what my VP of engineer.

1664
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,237
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

1665
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,739
Precisely. So,

1666
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:27,076
to me,

1667
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,645
the ability to implement
these rules,

1668
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,748
right, as system
prompts, as agents

1669
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:36,018
allow us to move from

1670
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,423
having
to focus on coordination

1671
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,926
to just making sure that
we get the right signal

1672
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,263
during the transcripts

1673
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:49,598
of our human
to human conversations.

1674
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,299
Does that make sense?

1675
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:54,603
I mean, I would
do it to this call, right?

1676
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,572
So that's exactly
what we're going to do

1677
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,673
re transcribe it.

1678
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:58,908
There's probably

1679
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,310
so I, I usually have
three sections.

1680
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,847
So the first section is 
what was decided

1681
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,515
is typically
the meetings thing.

1682
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:06,982
So we have,

1683
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:10,453
we have to decide what
the course of action is.

1684
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:11,320
Right.

1685
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,256
And then the other section
is next steps.

1686
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,792
So these are more like
more every right.

1687
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:20,162
There's no specific person
that has to do anything.

1688
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,163
But it's more like

1689
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,132
look into something
something right.

1690
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,801
Or you know,
our next step is

1691
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:29,839
to do some discovery
into as BTC,

1692
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,041
payment
gateway with Shopify.

1693
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,442
Right. But then that

1694
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,744
the last section
is the action items.

1695
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,247
And so action
items are more specific.

1696
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:39,248
And so you actually

1697
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,451
assign it with a person
with the name or the team.

1698
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:44,186
Right. With a name.

1699
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,455
And so, you know,

1700
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:47,623
you divide things
into that

1701
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,159
and then you assign it
to someone on linear

1702
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:51,260
to get a notification.

1703
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,728
And then
you just do the work.

1704
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,735
Or the
AI is doing the work,

1705
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:02,238
you assign it to cloud.

1706
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:21,957
I phone

1707
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,460
that, can you hear me?

1708
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:25,361
Yeah, I can hear you.

1709
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,630
I think that's a sign
that it's time to get off.

1710
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,264
Yeah.

1711
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:33,235
So let's,
If you were to suggest,

1712
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:38,073
some of the elements
that the HCI would pay

1713
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,576
attention to, again,
you don't

1714
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:41,911
necessarily.

1715
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:42,978
Does that make sense?

1716
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:45,080
But what are the key
things

1717
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,517
that you would suggest
that the AI focus on,

1718
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,619
even if it's just,
you know,

1719
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,321
not related to stacks
AI Guild,

1720
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,790
but helps everything
overall?

1721
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:01,530
Like for myself,
I think it just comes down

1722
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,033
to how do we build up
distribution channels?

1723
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,205
For me personally,
I mean, maybe that means

1724
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,172
building up

1725
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:11,240
like more content,

1726
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,742
posting more often,
more regularly.

1727
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:17,780
I think we made a great
bet on Nate n

1728
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:18,948
that it will

1729
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:21,450
become popular
and it will become useful,

1730
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,153
and I think we need to
double down on that. That

1731
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:26,422
like, I
think that's a pretty safe

1732
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:29,458
bet to learn and
and from the ground up.

1733
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:30,659
Right.

1734
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:33,395
Learn all the changes,
whatever the struggle is.

1735
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:33,596
Right.

1736
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,732
Because I know that, like,
maybe the docs aren't,

1737
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,934
updated or like,
you know,

1738
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,237
and had an update recently
and, you know, maybe

1739
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,206
cursor is very good at it
yet with a new context,

1740
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,975
but we just need to

1741
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,777
overcome that hurdle,
maybe create our own

1742
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:50,846
version of the docs.
Right.

1743
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:54,650
Provide that as markdown
contacts, whatever it is.

1744
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:54,917
Right.

1745
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:58,020
I think for our team,
getting really,

1746
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,555
really good at no end

1747
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,690
is going to
give us a lot of leverage,

1748
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:02,491
especially since I have

1749
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,094
this freaking PC
that has 64 gigs,

1750
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:07,162
about gigabytes of Ram,
and a ton of memory.

1751
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,931
That's like
not doing anything right.

1752
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,835
Originally
we were going to run local

1753
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:16,105
lmms on it,
but then Open Router has a

1754
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,841
ton of different models
that we can

1755
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,777
just use for free,
that are way faster.

1756
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:22,077
Right.

1757
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,947
And so now
how do we reallocate this

1758
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:28,584
resource that is my
PC as well as Aiden's PC,

1759
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,120
because he has both a
mac and a PC

1760
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,755
that has plenty of memory

1761
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:35,257
and GPU power
to just run things.

1762
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,427
I have a suggestion
for a decision

1763
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:41,163
and next steps.

1764
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,866
How might we take in the.

1765
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:48,270
Mid journey

1766
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,773
prompt?

1767
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,109
Process,

1768
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:56,612
which acts as a

1769
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,048
PhD and film direction

1770
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:01,083
into an end point

1771
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:03,786
such that the stacks
I Guild creators

1772
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,654
can take their prompts

1773
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,157
or their ideas
and just like you did,

1774
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:12,361
get ten x to 100 x
Jason prompts,

1775
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,930
which are under 1000
characters, so whatever.

1776
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,167
So for me is

1777
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,937
so I've already assigned
sort of, this is like

1778
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:25,040
the third priority
of a project for Aiden.

1779
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,609
So he already knows and
and right.

1780
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,377
I think the next thing

1781
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:31,046
that he needs help with is
we need Vance back.

1782
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:33,549
I know he, you know, he's
he's doing his thing.

1783
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,584
He's got family
obligations. Right?

1784
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:39,054
But he's our stable
diffusion local.

1785
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:42,424
That's relative image
and video I perked up.

1786
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:43,292
Yeah.

1787
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,827
And maybe we don't
wait for him.

1788
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,795
Maybe we connect with Jim.

1789
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:47,129
Right?

1790
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,263
Maybe we connect with

1791
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,099
maybe someone here
in this room

1792
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:52,101
and I go over this one.

1793
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,703
What if I use this
conversation

1794
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:55,971
to create an agent

1795
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:57,506
that has a conversation
with him?

1796
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:01,009
So when he's driving,
he can just provide us

1797
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:02,277
and therefore
everyone the.

1798
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,113
And does
that make sense. Yeah.

1799
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:06,181
Yeah.

1800
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:09,518
So maybe we take
the the granola notes.

1801
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:09,752
Yeah.

1802
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,421
Create a notebook
like notebook out

1803
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,990
loud recap for him
that he can just listen to

1804
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,991
as like a podcast.

1805
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,159
Yes. So he knows what

1806
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,595
his next steps
and his action items are.

1807
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:21,930
Well so what
I'm thinking is,

1808
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,433
is I'm
starting to really derive

1809
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,035
a lot of benefit
from 11 lapses.

1810
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,772
One of the next steps
is I'm going to convert

1811
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:33,175
this conversation
into one of the outputs

1812
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,778
is going to be a system
prompt for an 11 lapse

1813
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:38,280
agent that can have
a conversation

1814
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,849
with Vance.

1815
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,151
Does that make sense?

1816
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:43,185
Yeah. Right.

1817
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,487
So we can entertain
and comfy

1818
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:47,122
everything
that we're doing.

1819
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:50,426
Right now
because I think that

1820
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,595
if we can do anything
that's helpful,

1821
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:57,466
it's to help people
create better prompts.

1822
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,569
And if they want to learn
how, they can learn how.

1823
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:02,438
But the initial step
is ten x.

1824
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:04,139
My prompt.

1825
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,608
I'm sure I'm not
the only person who wants

1826
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,111
or is trying to design
something at the prompt.

1827
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:12,080
And from what
I've seen, I'm biased.

1828
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:15,451
It's you and three Hannah
that has the best

1829
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,752
pieces of content
right now.

1830
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:17,252
With ball,

1831
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:20,722
you pick and Nozpheratu
and GG for this stuff.

1832
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:24,393
And so, 
that's what I'm thinking.

1833
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,228
So for Stack's I Guild,

1834
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:27,763
which wants to position
itself

1835
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,032
as the dominant layer two
for Bitcoin

1836
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,668
and mindshare Gartner
Magic Quadrant.

1837
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,971
The purpose of the stacks
I guild in relation to

1838
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:39,508
that goal is to create,

1839
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:43,245
media and social campaigns
and marketing campaigns

1840
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,848
that achieve
the impressions

1841
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,483
and the views
and the comments

1842
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,252
and the likes and the tags
that are so important

1843
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:54,289
to crossing the chasm
and having a plus one

1844
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,225
Net Promoter score

1845
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,427
and so,

1846
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:00,929
one of the decisions is to

1847
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,365
help ten x
all of the creators

1848
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,300
make their problems
better.

1849
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,470
But the
other piece is to,

1850
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:16,445
Encourage

1851
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,947
collaboration more.

1852
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:22,317
Have I missed anything?

1853
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:23,552
Rocky?

1854
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:24,486
No, I think that's good.

1855
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:24,753
I think

1856
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:27,222
one of the things that
I thought of is, like,

1857
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:30,158
there are other people
that I follow on X,

1858
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:32,127
right,
that are great creators

1859
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,996
and they're they're

1860
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,498
I have already figure it
out sort of the source

1861
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,433
within the prompts.

1862
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:39,401
Right, right.

1863
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:42,337
I think what I need to do
is like as I'm generating

1864
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:43,972
them,
like actually post them

1865
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:46,308
as a reply
to those very same people.

1866
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,610
That's where
all my bookmarks. Right.

1867
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:50,979
Like,
let's not do it in silo.

1868
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:53,215
But like he's like, hey,
I use your prompt.

1869
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,615
And this is

1870
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:56,118
what came out like,
how do I improve this?

1871
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,085
Right?

1872
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,488
Maybe they respond w
fantastic, right?

1873
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,123
Well, maybe
they don't respond. Right.

1874
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:04,226
But I think doing more of
that is going to be good

1875
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:05,761
just for you.

1876
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,796
Just for my own
improvements.

1877
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:08,096
Right.

1878
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:10,432
But I think that's part of
how do you build up

1879
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:11,800
distribution
channels as well.

1880
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,736
And my
final question, we are

1881
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:18,240
participating in the Dora
Hacks as BTC hackathon.

1882
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,610
And you've alluded
to the SDC and Shopify.

1883
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:22,945
Can you talk about your

1884
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:25,681
background with Shopify
and why you chose this

1885
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:27,749
as an outcome?

1886
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:32,287
And then, talk about how
we're going to use linear

1887
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,790
to manage
this next process

1888
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,758
and this next
phase of the build a thons

1889
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,027
where we do a build on
every single day,

1890
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,530
sometimes three of them
at the same time.

1891
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:46,201
Yeah.

1892
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:47,102
Well, I, I found

1893
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:50,005
I found it through Dora
Hacks right from the other

1894
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:53,642
I think the other one was
the AI one that we did.

1895
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:54,476
Right.

1896
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:57,613
A couple of months back,
I believe.

1897
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:02,050
So why Shopify?

1898
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,118
Well, because base

1899
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,621
has an integration
with Shopify, right?

1900
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,022
I think right now

1901
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,657
a lot of the things
that we're building on

1902
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,792
stacks
is like built in silo.

1903
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:11,727
Right.

1904
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,862
And that's not
what vendors want.

1905
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:14,162
Right?

1906
01:17:14,162 --> 01:17:14,630
Like you're

1907
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,531
you're going to share this
to my CEO.

1908
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,799
He's going to be like,
what is connect

1909
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:18,800
with right.

1910
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,236
We're making all
of our money on Shopify.

1911
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:21,603
Right.

1912
01:17:21,603 --> 01:17:24,106
Why does it matter
that I'm capturing,

1913
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:27,909
you know, $10,000 on this
obscure blockchain?

1914
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,444
Like they're not even care
about that shit.

1915
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:30,812
They're
making $30 million.

1916
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,550
So we have
to integrate with systems

1917
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:38,420
that already have high
liquidity.

1918
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:39,588
Right.

1919
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:43,425
And so, you know, my
ten years in e-commerce

1920
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:46,828
and building
mostly on Shopify, right?

1921
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,964
I've done WordPress,
right.

1922
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:51,600
But Shopify makes it
super simple and easy.

1923
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,636
And there's a reason
why Shopify partnered up

1924
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:58,106
with, with with base
chain with Coinbase

1925
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,342
and partnered up
with stripe

1926
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,277
to get this done right.

1927
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:02,911
And guess what?

1928
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,447
A lot of that
information is public.

1929
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:06,782
They literally wrote

1930
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:10,252
a blog post
on how to build a payment

1931
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:13,622
gateway on Shopify
for blockchains.

1932
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:14,890
Right?

1933
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:15,657
So instead of

1934
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:18,493
just building
like a random gateway

1935
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:22,264
that only works for this
one super custom obscure

1936
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:26,368
vendor to, 
build it for the largest,

1937
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,904
you know, direct
to consumer e-commerce

1938
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,505
platform
that you can think of.

1939
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,307
And to me, that Shopify.

1940
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,953
And, what's our niche that
we're going to focus on

1941
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,823
and what demonstrate
what's the demonstration

1942
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,391
going to show?

1943
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:49,758
Sure.

1944
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:52,194
So assuming that we can
take payments, right.

1945
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:54,830
There's no reason why
we can't take donations.

1946
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:55,564
Right.

1947
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,431
And so as,

1948
01:18:56,431 --> 01:18:59,101
part of the add on
or plug in to the payment

1949
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:01,870
gateway is
we want to let nonprofits

1950
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:06,541
be able to accept as BTC
and St as part

1951
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,444
of donations
and businesses.

1952
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:13,014
So I'm not talking
like ten, right, $100.

1953
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:13,882
Right?

1954
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:14,249
Sure.

1955
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,151
Like people who donate

1956
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:18,019
that much,
they might want a receipt.

1957
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,622
But if you're a business
and you're donating

1958
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:23,158
thousands,
if not tens of thousands,

1959
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,560
hundreds
of thousands of dollars

1960
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,963
to any nonprofit
that you know

1961
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:29,831
has a mission
that they believe in,

1962
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:33,034
they will want a receipt,
right, for the IRS,

1963
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,803
especially if you're here
in the United States.

1964
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:35,637
Right.

1965
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:36,171
Because,

1966
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:36,571
they're going to

1967
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:39,040
want to claim
that as a tax write off.

1968
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:40,308
Right.

1969
01:19:40,308 --> 01:19:41,376
And so,

1970
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:42,778
you know,
maybe it's to offset

1971
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,714
other gains, maybe
it's to do some, you know,

1972
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,216
interesting, 
creative accounting.

1973
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,918
Right. Creative finance.

1974
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,620
They're going
to want a receipt

1975
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,222
and they're not going
to want to pay,

1976
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,591
you know, a couple
hundred dollars extra

1977
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:57,425
because
they're a nonprofit.

1978
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:58,326
They don't have
a ton of money.

1979
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,327
They rather spend a couple

1980
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,162
hundred dollars

1981
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:02,664
on their project or
furthering their mission.

1982
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:03,532
Right.

1983
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:07,002
So instead of, having
the, the businesses,

1984
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:10,772
pay for specialized
accounting software,

1985
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,209
let's build a tool
that looks up on the block

1986
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:15,644
explorer, right,

1987
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,679
and generate
an actual receipt

1988
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:19,714
for the people
who are donating. Right.

1989
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:22,350
Then they can put that
into it, into their IRS

1990
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,053
form and file it up,
or save it somewhere.

1991
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:25,821
Right.

1992
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,023
And I think that's going
to encourage more,

1993
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,325
donations
to nonprofit projects.

1994
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,797
So imagine
you're narrating the demo,

1995
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,433
and in their mind's eye,
your narration is going

1996
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:39,835
to paint the picture.

1997
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,604
How's the demo work that
we're submitting to a tax?

1998
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:46,408
Well,

1999
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,910
I think we do, the spin
method.

2000
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:50,712
Right. What is the current
situation?

2001
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:50,946
Right.

2002
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:51,980
The current situation is

2003
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,482
that CTC
is difficult to use.

2004
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:54,916
Right?

2005
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:58,353
We don't have a,
you know, what are the,

2006
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,855
the major e-commerce

2007
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,323
platforms
that we're connected in?

2008
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:05,560
How do nonprofits today
take donations on stacks?

2009
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:06,761
Right.

2010
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,264
Well, we're
building the solution

2011
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,833
with this MVP, right?

2012
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:14,502
The problem is that
the UI, UX is not good.

2013
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,272
The other problems
is that,

2014
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:20,308
as users, you may want
a receipt, right?

2015
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,843
When you're donating
to a nonprofit

2016
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,378
through a payment gateway

2017
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:25,680
and be able to generate
a receipt either.

2018
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:26,815
So you can file it in
your tax

2019
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:29,050
return at the end
of the year. Right.

2020
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,921
And so, what are the

2021
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,023
what are the implications
of not solving this?

2022
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,391
Well, the implication is,

2023
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,894
TVL on stacks
does not grow.

2024
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:42,731
Transaction volume
continues to plateau.

2025
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,033
If not, go down. Right.

2026
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:47,435
And the net payoff
is if we do

2027
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,071
solve this problem, right,
then merchants

2028
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:53,041
and vendors
are able to deploy,

2029
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:57,545
stacks payment gateway
with CTC, with Shopify,

2030
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:58,480
one of the

2031
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,683
largest e-commerce
platforms on the planet.

2032
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:05,520
It you last time
we talked about,

2033
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,188
you know, on chain
Nigerians.

2034
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,958
Well, well, Shopify
it works in Nigeria.

2035
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,394
It also works
in South Africa.

2036
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,196
So if anyone there
wants to start

2037
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,900
a Shopify store,
you can and accept as BTC.

2038
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,703
And by the time
this is in production,

2039
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,873
sorry, did you take
this to my final prompt?

2040
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,541
Now that we've done
the spin is pitch

2041
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:27,375
anything?

2042
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,878
Pitch anything starts
with high contract,

2043
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:33,381
high impact visual people
doing things over time.

2044
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:35,050
And then

2045
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,352
we talk about the
three markets that you've

2046
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,921
already talked about,
which is, come

2047
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:42,624
creating this opportunity,

2048
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:45,360
which is the need for
donations and liquidity

2049
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,428
for charities

2050
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:47,362
and the need for

2051
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:48,930
BTC to flow

2052
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,831
and the need for there

2053
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:51,900
to be a receipt
for regulatory

2054
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,902
and political
and legal reasons.

2055
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:54,970
And then we have the big

2056
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,539
idea with interest priced
high morality.

2057
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:00,041
So without having to do
all of those things

2058
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:02,844
in that order, that's just
a pitch anything model.

2059
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:04,612
Now that you've
articulated

2060
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:05,213
the problem worth

2061
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:07,716
solving or job to be done
or outcome

2062
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,686
for, charities who want
to accept donations in

2063
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,223
digital synthetic bitcoin

2064
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,093
that is kosher
for political, legal

2065
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:21,863
and regulatory bodies
to which they must comply.

2066
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,666
How would you pitch this

2067
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,068
now that you've discussed

2068
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:29,571
the spin?

2069
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:33,541
I think the picture comes.

2070
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,044
You gotta come in strong
with expertise, right?

2071
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,379
Like,
I think for myself, it's

2072
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,748
the ten years
in e-commerce, right?

2073
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,784
Earlier
you talked about, Now

2074
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:45,453
I'm in, sort of, 
a place of authority,

2075
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:46,621
I suppose, a little bit

2076
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,957
with the engineering
manager expertise.

2077
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:49,691
Right.

2078
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,193
I mean, just,

2079
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:54,262
I think we do a deep
research on

2080
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:56,765
how much money gets
transacted on Shopify.

2081
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:59,267
Right.

2082
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,903
Look at other examples.

2083
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:02,303
You know,

2084
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:04,806
we do compute competitor
research, right?

2085
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:05,907
Our direct competitor

2086
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:08,109
is going to be based
chain, right.

2087
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,512
They got this huge backing
from Coinbase.

2088
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:15,183
And they're already
integrated with base pay

2089
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,787
right to pay with Usdc
with Shopify.

2090
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:19,054
Right.

2091
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,522
And so if we want to
keep up,

2092
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:22,590
we're going to have
to create a Shopify

2093
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:25,593
payment
gateway, to, to compete

2094
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,830
with all these other alts.

2095
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,799
So there's an opportunity
for competition

2096
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:33,835
or cooperation, so to
speak, where you kind of

2097
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:37,138
cooperate
with your competitors

2098
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:40,642
to, chop up the market
share, our total,

2099
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:43,211
addressable market.

2100
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:44,913
So last thing, Rocky.

2101
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,382
So, for this final phase,

2102
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:51,386
can you,
we've done the spin.

2103
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:55,123
Can you just explain it
to the door hacks, folks?

2104
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,892
Very, succinctly

2105
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:02,097
one last time for this
Sbdc donation.

2106
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:05,867
We understand
why we want to do it now.

2107
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:09,571
Why you
why you specifically?

2108
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,873
So it's a combination
of only about yourself

2109
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:14,642
and then tell me
what you're going to do,

2110
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:17,178
which is essentially
what you've already done

2111
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:18,346
because of your experience

2112
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:20,181
is not something
you think you can do.

2113
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:20,682
This is something

2114
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:22,050
you already know
how to do,

2115
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,785
and you have cloud code
to do it for you. Now.

2116
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:27,655
Yeah, I think answering
the question about why

2117
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:30,458
I do it right, I mean,
I think the history of,

2118
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:33,061
you know, volunteer work,
working with nonprofits,

2119
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,930
I think that's a strong
why for me,

2120
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:38,600
for everything
that we do.

2121
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,667
Right,
whether it's Exponent

2122
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,170
Labs, whether it's my day
job. Right.

2123
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:44,439
I think end
goal is for myself

2124
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:46,541
is to run charity
gifts. Right.

2125
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:50,678
Being able to take, like
I, I think corporate

2126
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:54,215
gifting is a $60 billion
market and growing.

2127
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:55,383
Right.

2128
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:58,286
And being able
to leverage my already

2129
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,921
my knowledge of Shopify,

2130
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:02,423
being able to connect it
to nonprofit,

2131
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:06,327
nonprofit projects and,
you know, visions

2132
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,730
and projects
that I believe in. Right.

2133
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:12,367
And now combine
that with stacks, right?

2134
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:13,568
Like if if nonprofit

2135
01:26:13,568 --> 01:26:16,437
profits are able to accept
SPC and St

2136
01:26:17,071 --> 01:26:20,708
and earn a yield
right on chain

2137
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:23,778
and be able to further
stretch out their,

2138
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:26,281
project funding goals,

2139
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:29,717
that's that's a strong
MTP to me, right?

2140
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,787
That is the massive
transformative purpose

2141
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:35,823
is being able to help
nonprofits, being able

2142
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,326
to stretch their already
thin funds

2143
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:41,296
to further their project
longer and better

2144
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,665
and to be more effective.
Right.

2145
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:44,999
That would be my why?

2146
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:49,370
And, sorry,
this is the final one.

2147
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,271
I would I'll,

2148
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,473
I'll give you the prompt
to start with.

2149
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:53,041
Hello.

2150
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,611
My name is Rocky
and I'm a blanket blank.

2151
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:00,114
And what we're going to be
submitting to the Dora

2152
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:03,151
hacks SPC hackathon
is the following.

2153
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:06,087
Prototype and demo.

2154
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:07,722
Well, okay.

2155
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,657
Hello, my name is Rocky.

2156
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:11,159
I am,

2157
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:14,062
now, engineering manager
at Elite Team Health.

2158
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:15,930
Ten years experience

2159
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:19,801
working with Shopify
Plus and vendors, helping

2160
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:23,838
vendors scale
from a million RR to,

2161
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,574
beyond 30 million RR.

2162
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,044
And so today we're

2163
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:34,148
delivering an MVP
for an SP, BTC payment

2164
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:37,218
gateway to nonprofit
organization,

2165
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:40,688
accept donations
as well as generate,

2166
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:43,791
receipts
based on on chain data,

2167
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:48,463
so that nonprofits can,
utilize the blockchain

2168
01:27:48,463 --> 01:27:49,464
more efficiently

2169
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:52,834
with better, easier
to use, user experiences.

2170
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:58,740
I have
nothing left to say.

2171
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:02,543
How do you feel about how,
Now, I'd like you to.

2172
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:03,044
Sorry.

2173
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:03,911
This is the final one, but

2174
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:05,947
this is good for the AGI.

2175
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,116
What did you notice?

2176
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,051
What did you like?
What didn't you like?

2177
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:12,353
What would you change and
how would you change it?

2178
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:14,856
About the way
that I hosted today's

2179
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:17,358
session.

2180
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:21,095
You better recording this
you than it is recording.

2181
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:21,362
Yeah.

2182
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:24,766
Because, No,
I mean, I think the,

2183
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,367
the prompting style is
good.

2184
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:27,268
I mean,

2185
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,337
I was hoping that
more people would come up

2186
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:30,772
and we can ask them
questions, right?

2187
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:33,274
I think heroes doing
something else right now.

2188
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:37,245
Yeah.

2189
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:38,646
I mean, the style is fine.

2190
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,315
Maybe. Yeah.

2191
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:43,985
I'm hoping eventually,
like, we actually have,

2192
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:47,955
we have
Cindy back, likely.

2193
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,190
And I would love to just

2194
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:53,161
prompt the AI directly
and just co collaborate,

2195
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:56,164
live in spaces again
with and align

2196
01:28:56,597 --> 01:28:58,866
very soon.

2197
01:28:58,866 --> 01:29:01,903
I am not going to be
the one host

2198
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:03,504
in this space.

2199
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:04,605
Does that make sense.

2200
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:07,508
And so just to put a fine
point on it,

2201
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:10,345
what did you notice
about how I hosted today?

2202
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,613
Space. What you like,
what didn't you like?

2203
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:14,582
What would you change and
how would you change it?

2204
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,583
Again,
you don't have to worry

2205
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,851
about hurting my feelings

2206
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,020
because these signals
are being processed

2207
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,522
by someone else
or something else. Now.

2208
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:23,725
I mean, I would love

2209
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,560
to get feedback
from the listeners

2210
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,627
and people
in the room, right?

2211
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:31,566
Because I think sometimes
we, say things

2212
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:33,267
or talk about things,
especially

2213
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:36,437
like topics or subjects,
especially acronyms,

2214
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:40,041
that other people
may not be familiar with.

2215
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:40,241
Right?

2216
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:43,144
So it depends on
who are we talking to.

2217
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:43,978
Right.

2218
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:46,013
If you're
talking to just me

2219
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,149
and we're just recording
this for my sake,

2220
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:50,151
you know, right. With,

2221
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,453
you know, who my actual
intended audience is?

2222
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,890
Who is that?

2223
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,692
Dora hacks
and the Treasury.

2224
01:29:57,692 --> 01:29:59,494
Okay,

2225
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:01,295
so now that you know
who the target market

2226
01:30:01,295 --> 01:30:03,798
of today's conversation
with is,

2227
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:07,435
the Treasury Committee
and the door hacks who are

2228
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:10,438
and who are in charge
of all of this funding,

2229
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:13,474
how would you again
what did you like?

2230
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,575
What didn't you like?

2231
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:15,176
Now that you know,

2232
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:16,878
my overall objective, I'm

2233
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:17,645
sorry I didn't tell you

2234
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:19,380
my overall objective,
I should have.

2235
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:19,747
I don't want

2236
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:22,650
to be manipulative,
but this recording today

2237
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:26,854
was to demonstrate
how the syndicate operates

2238
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:30,391
as a community within
the community, and stacks

2239
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:33,194
seemed to be Cardano
and seem to be based.

2240
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,033
Yeah.

2241
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,201
I mean,
I think if we're targeting

2242
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:43,404
the the
the hackathon organizers,

2243
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:46,741
I think it's fine, but
we don't we also don't

2244
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:51,045
want to assume,
that they are tactical.

2245
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:52,313
Right.

2246
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:55,750
Just because they're
running a technical

2247
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:56,584
hackathon

2248
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:58,853
doesn't necessarily mean
that they are technical.

2249
01:30:58,853 --> 01:30:59,620
Right.

2250
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,756
And so being able

2251
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:04,325
to explain things

2252
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:06,828
in more plain language
would probably be good.

2253
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,931
And this is for myself
too, right?

2254
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,568
Because I'm so used to, 
Shopify related terms.

2255
01:31:13,935 --> 01:31:14,168
Yeah.

2256
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:17,104
So, I will say this,

2257
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,976
The people in the
Treasury Committee or Dora

2258
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:24,679
Hacks will never listen
to this full conversation.

2259
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,250
They will only ever,
maybe get the Lem

2260
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,252
summary
of this conversation

2261
01:31:31,252 --> 01:31:33,354
or see the demo as
they see the prototypes.

2262
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:34,455
Does that make sense?

2263
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:35,256
But yeah,

2264
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:36,257
for the people

2265
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:39,026
in those positions who are
looking to do funding,

2266
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,997
my intention is that
today was a demonstration

2267
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:46,968
of not only how
we think about things,

2268
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:50,771
about the specific markets
that we're looking at

2269
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:51,906
and also

2270
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:54,408
the process of decision
making we go through

2271
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,311
as we participate
in these hackathons.

2272
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,080
And then they can decide

2273
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,848
through their
underwriting team

2274
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:03,351
whether we're
just wasting our breath

2275
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:05,953
or actually doing
something significant.

2276
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:11,726
I like it,

2277
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:14,362
I hope the MDP and demo
videos will just speak

2278
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:15,663
for themselves
once it's all done.

2279
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,233
They didn't speak.

2280
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:21,769
They changed reality
such that they had spoken.

2281
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:24,772
Terry Pratchett
any final words?

2282
01:32:24,772 --> 01:32:27,275
Rocky?

2283
01:32:27,909 --> 01:32:28,809
No, I think it's good.

2284
01:32:28,809 --> 01:32:30,244
I think now we just run

2285
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:31,412
into the transcript,
do the.

2286
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:32,980
Let me get a summary

2287
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,449
into action items
and go to linear

2288
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:38,519
and start crunching away
that cool life.

2289
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,222
So today, like
before we talked right.

2290
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:42,490
It was WhatsApp
conversation.

2291
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,991
Hey, we got to kick
this thing off.

2292
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:45,793
And so I was like,
okay, perfect.

2293
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:47,028
Let's kick this off.

2294
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:49,830
This is this transfer
app will provide

2295
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:52,266
more than enough data
for cloud code

2296
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:53,568
to do the rest,
am I right?

2297
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:56,070
Have we really missed
anything?

2298
01:32:57,905 --> 01:32:58,339
Nope.

2299
01:32:58,339 --> 01:32:59,373
I'm already running.

2300
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:02,343
I already did
run like two hours

2301
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:05,012
worth of deep research
with cloud. So

2302
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,449
we are we already have
the contacts ready to go.

2303
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:10,952
So my job and this is good
for the recording is

2304
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:13,321
I am going to end
this Twitter space.

2305
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:15,056
I'm going to use
light sheets.

2306
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:18,593
So to generate an MP3
or an m4a of this Twitter

2307
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:19,393
space.

2308
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:20,461
And then
what are we going to

2309
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:21,662
do with
the transcript Rocky.

2310
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:23,864
Because
you know cloud go back.

2311
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:26,367
And I am I'm using
cursor for now.

2312
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:27,969
I mean, you can try

2313
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,937
running
a summary on your own,

2314
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:31,472
but you should
send a copy to me

2315
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:34,542
and then I'll run it
through sonnet for 4.1.

2316
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:36,677
Right.
And see if it's better.

2317
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:36,978
Right.

2318
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:39,480
Maybe if it's something
that the cursor doesn't.

2319
01:33:40,047 --> 01:33:42,717
That's a great idea. So,

2320
01:33:43,951 --> 01:33:45,953
I guess I should do
the summary.

2321
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:48,456
This is being,

2322
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:50,524
the organized media
featuring

2323
01:33:50,524 --> 01:33:54,462
the syndicate stacks
AI guild applied AGI.

2324
01:33:54,962 --> 01:33:56,998
AGI is, as AGI

2325
01:33:56,998 --> 01:33:59,500
does, unanimous
AI has proven

2326
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,470
through their predictions
of the Oscars and the NC

2327
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:08,175
Double-A Final Four
and the MLB winners

2328
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:09,910
that because they do

2329
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:12,413
the best predictions
on the market

2330
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:15,516
that they're

2331
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:16,617
implementation of

2332
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:19,120
AI is fiscally the most

2333
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:22,023
rewarding of all
implementations of AI.

2334
01:34:22,423 --> 01:34:25,393
And they are specifically
including humans in

2335
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:25,860
the loop

2336
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:27,395
to make the

2337
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:29,897
best bets on the planet.

2338
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:32,700
So if AGI is, as AGI does,

2339
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:36,270
the real benefit of AI, in
my opinion,

2340
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:37,805
is to increase

2341
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:41,208
collaboration between
the humans together

2342
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,376
such that the

2343
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:44,311
AI can have
the information

2344
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:46,981
that the AI doesn't
necessarily have

2345
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:49,950
in documented shops
or on the internet,

2346
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:52,687
the signals
that are only processed

2347
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:55,189
by humans and their unique

2348
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:58,059
gifts of bias.

2349
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:00,094
Again, this is being
the syndicate

2350
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:02,797
on the organized stacks
AI Guild.

2351
01:35:05,466 --> 01:35:06,567
We hope to see you soon.
